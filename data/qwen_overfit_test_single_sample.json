So give me a second here guys. I'm going to get everything set up and sent out here, but we are going to get things started here. As you'll notice, I am not alone on the camera today. I have Callie Cooper from Wellington Main Streets here with me. So we're super excited to get a chance to talk with her a little bit about Wellington Main Streets and just kind of some of the things that are going on here in Wellington. So looking forward to that. I will be ready in just a second if I can figure out how to do this. There we go. You would think I would be good at doing this now, but I still have moments where I'm like, what am I doing? Then of course, Facebook likes to go and change things on me. And I'm like, what? Then of course, the internet is running much slower now than it used to because everyone is now of\n\nSpeaker 1: course using\n\nSpeaker 1: the internet on the internet all the time. So things that I used to be\n\nSpeaker 1: like, Oh, there's\n\nSpeaker 1: never be issues with this. I'm like, wow, there's issues with this now. This is not something I ever expected to have a problem with. All right, well, let's go ahead and get things kicked off. So my name is John Gator and this is my weekly podcast and just live from Wellington and we talk about what's going on here in the town of Wellington. And as I mentioned a little bit earlier, I'm excited to be joined by Callie Cooper and she is what's your title officially, Callie? So I don't mess it up here\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, no, you're fine. I am the executive director of the Wellington Main Streets\n\nSpeaker 1: . Awesome. All right. Well, for those of us that may not have a great idea of what the Main Streets program is, could you just tell us a little bit about yourself and also tell us a little bit about the Main Streets and what you guys do for the for Wellington?\n\nSpeaker 2: Yeah, absolutely. So again, my name is Callie Cooper and I am with the Main Streets program. And what the Main Street program does or what we are is we are a 501c3 nonprofit here in Wellington and we focus on downtown revitalization. So we really talk a lot about how do we create an atmosphere that people want to be in in downtown? How do we support businesses? How do we support residents? And how do we also protect the integrity and the historical character of our downtown? So those are kind of some of the things that we touch on. Some of the big projects that you might know of or might not know that we are a part of are, you know, we are responsible for the downtown flower planters. We are\n\nSpeaker 2: responsible\n\nSpeaker 2: for the murals in downtown. We also partner with other organizations for events like the Wellington Brewfest, the 0.5K fun run. And our event is the our big event of the year is the Wellerama Music Festival. We're still crossing our\n\nSpeaker 2: fingers may or may\n\nSpeaker 2: not happen. So yeah, so those are some of the things that we do. But internally, we also touched a little bit on economic development, business promotion and support. And like I said, some of those historical surveys and getting some of our downtown buildings on the national and state historic registry."
