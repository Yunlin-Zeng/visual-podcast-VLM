we had one final morning exercise before graduation . it was our chance to say goodbye to the `` red monster '' that we had all struggled over at some point during our training . that afternoon , dressed in our formal uniforms , we got the final salute from our commander , and then it was official . we had graduated . mom took a picture to show that i left behind my program in my excitement after the ceremony . but i was eager to get that brand new rank pinned to my cap .
