i now introduce a man who probably needs no introduction , mr. [male] sampson . mr. sampson spoke movingly to the crowd about the need for better eye care in location . he listened well to the questions during the question and answer session . he did get a bit annoyed at some of the ignorance out there about glasses . this guy especially , with his wide-eyed stare , made mr. sampson a bit peeved .
