saint paddy 's day is special to [male] since he 's irish . but lack of irish blood did n't stop anyone else from having a good time . his sister moira had flown in from location and she was having fun as well . but like i said , everyone did , irish or not . then [male] got all quiet and started quoting [male] [female] and things got weird .
