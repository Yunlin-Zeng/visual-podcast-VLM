it 's a gorgeous day to be outside . we 're enjoying the sights and the peaceful atmosphere . the fresh air is a wonderful addition , and we ca n't get enough of it ! moving further away adds to the serenity and does n't diminish the regal beauty . the clear water lapping at the shores adds a harmony with nature that never gets old .
