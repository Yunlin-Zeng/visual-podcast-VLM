I've got my wooden cutting board here, and I'm pouring out about two cups of all-purpose flour into a little mountain shape.\n\nGuest: Oh that's beautiful! I love how you're making that well in the center. It's like a little volcano.\n\nHost: Exactly! Now I'm cracking three eggs right into this well. See how the bright yellow yolks are sitting there, perfectly intact? And now I'm taking my fork and I'm just gently beating the eggs, slowly incorporating the flour from the sides.\n\nGuest: The color is amazing - that golden yellow mixing with the white flour. It's almost like watching paint blend.\n\nHost: Right? And now I'm using my hands to bring it all together. The dough is still pretty shaggy at this point - you can see all these little bits of flour still on the board. My hands are completely covered in sticky dough.\n\nGuest: How long do you knead it for?\n\nHost: About 10 minutes. Watch - I'm pushing it away with the heel of my hand, folding it back, turning it a quarter turn. Push, fold, turn. Push, fold, turn. You can see it's getting smoother and more elastic now.\n\nGuest: It's changed so much! It went from that rough, shaggy mess to this smooth, silky ball.\n\nHost: Now I'm wrapping it in this plastic wrap and we'll let it rest for 30 minutes. While we wait, let me show you the pasta machine I'm going to use. It's this silver hand-crank one that clamps right onto the counter here.\n\nGuest: That's a beauty! Is that vintage?\n\nHost: It's my grandmother's actually. Still works perfectly. See these rollers here? We'll run the dough through, starting at the widest setting. But first, let me unwrap this dough - wow, it's so smooth now, feel how soft it is.\n\nGuest: Like silk!\n\nHost: I'm cutting it into four pieces. Now I'm taking this first piece and flattening it with my hands into a rough rectangle shape, about a quarter inch thick. I'm dusting it with flour so it doesn't stick. Now I'm feeding it through the widest setting on the machine.\n\nGuest: Oh wow, it's coming out the other side!\n\nHost: Yeah! And look how it stretches. Now I'm folding it in thirds like a letter, and I'll run it through again. We'll do this a few times. Each time it gets smoother and more uniform. See how it's going from this rough sheet to something really refined?\n\nGuest: The transformation is incredible. It's like watching fabric being woven.\n\nHost: Now I'm moving to the next setting, making it thinner. Watch how long the sheet gets as it comes through. I have to catch it with both hands now. It's getting so delicate I can almost see through it.\n\nGuest: Are you nervous it'll tear?\n\nHost: A little! This is the trickiest part. One more pass... there! Perfect! Now look at this - I'm holding up this long sheet of pasta, and you can see the window behind it. It's almost translucent.\n\nGuest: That's restaurant quality right there!\n\nHost: Thank you! Now I'm switching to the cutting attachment. This one makes fettuccine. Watch - I'm feeding the sheet through and these long ribbons are coming out the bottom. I'm catching them and laying them over this wooden drying rack here.\n\nGuest: They're draped over there like little golden curtains.\n\nHost: Exactly! And that's fresh pasta. From a pile of flour to this in about an hour.",
