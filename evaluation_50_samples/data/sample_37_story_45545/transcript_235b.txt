Speaker 1:  
You know, I swear this is the best lamb I’ve had since we went to that little place in the Barossa. The crust is just—perfect. Crispy, but not burnt. And that jus? I’m not even mad I used half my bread to mop it up.

Speaker 2:  
Right? And the asparagus underneath? So fresh. I think I saw the chef pick it this morning. Or maybe it was yesterday. Either way, it’s not that sad, limp green stuff you get at chain restaurants. This is legit.

Speaker 3:  
I’m telling you, the secret’s in the carrot shavings. They’re not just for show. They add this sweet crunch that cuts through the richness. I’d eat that whole plate again if they’d let me.

Speaker 4:  
You’d eat the whole table if they’d let you. Seriously, slow down. You’re gonna need a nap after this.

Speaker 5:  
Hey, I’m savoring! That’s what this is called. Savoring. Unlike you, who’s already eyeing the dessert menu like a raccoon at a dumpster.

Speaker 6:  
Guilty. But can you blame me? I’ve been waiting all week for this. And I’m not leaving until I’ve had that chocolate torte. You know the one—the one with the sea salt on top? Yeah. That’s my spirit animal.

Speaker 1:  
You’re gonna be the reason we all get kicked out. Again. Remember last year? The wine tasting? You started singing “Don’t Stop Believin’” at the top of your lungs and the owner had to ask us to leave.

Speaker 6:  
That was a cultural moment! And I was sober! Mostly. Besides, he laughed. I saw him laugh.

Speaker 2:  
He laughed because he was trying not to cry. That was a cry-laugh.

Speaker 3:  
Okay, okay, let’s not rehash the Great Wine Tasting Incident of 2022. Let’s talk about something better—like how amazing the wine is here. I mean, seriously. That Sauvignon Blanc? Crisp. Clean. Like biting into a green apple on a sunny day.

Speaker 4:  
I’m more of a red person. That Shiraz we got? Smoky. Bold. Pairs perfectly with the lamb. I’m gonna have to buy a case before we leave.

Speaker 5:  
You say that every time. And then you forget to buy it. And then you cry about it for three weeks.

Speaker 4:  
I do not cry! I… reflect. With emotion.

Speaker 6:  
You cry. We all know you cry.

Speaker 1:  
Alright, alright. Let’s not start a fight over wine. Or crying. Or singing. Let’s just enjoy this. Look around. This is what it’s all about, right? Good food, good wine, good company. And that view? I’d pay double for the view alone.

Speaker 2:  
True. It’s so peaceful out here. You can hear the birds, the breeze, the occasional sheep bleating in the distance. It’s like nature’s ASMR.

Speaker 3:  
ASMR? You’re losing me. I thought that was for whispering and tapping on things.

Speaker 2:  
No, no, it’s for anything that makes you feel calm and cozy. Like this. The clinking of glasses, the murmur of conversation, the smell of grilled meat and fresh herbs. That’s ASMR for grown-ups.

Speaker 5:  
I’ll take it. I’m all about the cozy. Especially after that third glass of wine. I’m starting to feel like a warm, fuzzy blanket.

Speaker 6:  
You’re not the only one. I think I’m gonna need a nap after dessert. Or maybe just lie down in the grass for a bit. Watch the clouds. Maybe spot a kangaroo.

Speaker 4:  
Kangaroos? Out here? I think you’ve had too much wine.

Speaker 6:  
Hey, you never know. They’re sneaky. They could be watching us right now. Judging our table manners.

Speaker 1:  
If they are, they’re probably impressed. We’re not spilling anything. Mostly.

Speaker 2:  
Speak for yourself. I just knocked over my water glass. But hey, it’s on the tablecloth. Not my lap. That’s a win.

Speaker 3:  
I’m just glad we’re all here. It’s been too long since we did this. Just… hung out. No agenda. No stress. Just food and wine and laughter.

Speaker 5:  
And occasional singing. Don’t forget the singing.

Speaker 6:  
Hey, I’m not the only one who sings. Who was it last week who belted out “Bohemian Rhapsody” in the shower? I heard you. Through the wall.

Speaker 5:  
That was… artistic expression. And it was in the shower. That’s a private space.

Speaker 4:  
Private space? You were loud enough to wake the neighbors. And the dog. And possibly the kangaroos.

Speaker 3:  
Alright, alright. Let’s not get into a singing war. Let’s just enjoy the moment. The food. The wine. The company. And if anyone starts singing, I’m throwing my napkin at them.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. But if you throw your napkin at me, I’m throwing it back. And then we’re both in trouble.

Speaker 2:  
You’re all ridiculous. But I love you. Now, who’s ready for dessert? I’m not waiting any longer. I’m gonna go flag down the waiter.

Speaker 6:  
Go get it. And while you’re at it, ask if they have that chocolate torte. I’m not leaving until I’ve had it.

Speaker 4:  
You’re impossible.

Speaker 6:  
And you love it.

Speaker 3:  
We do. Now go. Before we all start singing again.
