Speaker 1:  
Man, I still can’t believe I’m actually here. Like, I drove past that “Welcome to UCA” sign this morning and just… paused. It felt real for the first time. Like, “Oh, this is it. I’m a college student now.”

Speaker 2:  
Same. I think I took like three photos of that sign. My mom was like, “Honey, you’re gonna have to stop taking pictures of every campus landmark.” But hey, it’s my first week! Let’s be dramatic.

Speaker 3:  
Drama is mandatory. I mean, look at the welcome tent yesterday — free pastries, people handing out maps, someone even had a clipboard with “Welcome Student” on it. I felt like a VIP. Or at least, a slightly confused VIP.

Speaker 1:  
Right? I grabbed a cinnamon roll and a cup of coffee and just stood there for like ten minutes trying to figure out where the dorms were. The lady at the table was so nice, though. She didn’t even laugh when I asked if the library was “the big building with the columns.”

Speaker 2:  
Oh my gosh, I asked if the student center had a nap room. I swear, I was half-asleep walking in. They didn’t have one, but they did have a quiet lounge with these weirdly comfortable chairs. I think I napped there for twenty minutes after my first class.

Speaker 3:  
That’s the dream. I’m still trying to figure out how to not get lost between classes. I swear, every hallway looks the same. And don’t even get me started on the parking situation. I parked in Lot C yesterday and walked for twenty minutes just to find my building.

Speaker 1:  
I just gave up and started walking everywhere. I mean, it’s not that far, and honestly? I like it. I saw a group of people sitting on the grass near the quad, just laughing and eating lunch. It felt… normal. Like, “Oh, this is what college is supposed to feel like.”

Speaker 2:  
Totally. I sat with a couple of girls I met in my intro to psych class. We were comparing syllabi and complaining about the reading load. One of them had already bought all her textbooks — like, all of them. I’m still waiting for my financial aid to kick in.

Speaker 3:  
Same. I’m living off the library’s e-books and hoping I don’t get caught. But hey, at least I’m not alone. I saw a guy in the hallway today with a stack of books taller than his head. He looked like he was about to cry. I gave him a thumbs-up. He smiled. Small victories.

Speaker 1:  
I think the hardest part is just… figuring out the rhythm. Like, when do you eat? When do you study? When do you actually sleep? I stayed up until 2 a.m. last night trying to finish my first assignment. I think I wrote three paragraphs and then fell asleep with my laptop on my stomach.

Speaker 2:  
I did the same thing. Except I fell asleep on the couch in the student center. Woke up to someone tapping my shoulder and saying, “You’re blocking the coffee machine.” I think I mumbled something about “academic integrity” and shuffled away.

Speaker 3:  
That’s hilarious. I’m just trying to find my people, you know? Like, the group that’s gonna be my ride-or-die for the next four years. I met this girl in my biology lab — she’s super chill, and she brought her own highlighters to class. I’m already planning to study with her.

Speaker 1:  
I’m low-key hoping to find someone who’s good at math. I’m already dreading my stats class. I mean, I can barely calculate a tip at a restaurant. How am I supposed to do regression analysis?

Speaker 2:  
You’ll figure it out. And if not, there’s always tutoring. I went to the writing center yesterday just to get feedback on my personal statement. The tutor was so nice — she didn’t even flinch when I said I’d never written a five-paragraph essay before.

Speaker 3:  
I’m just trying to survive the first week. I’ve already been to the dining hall twice, and I’m already sick of the mystery meat. But hey, at least the salad bar is decent. And they have ice cream. That’s my lifeline.

Speaker 1:  
Same. I’m basically running on caffeine and sugar. I think I’ve had three coffees today and a donut. I’m not even sorry. College is hard, and I deserve treats.

Speaker 2:  
Agreed. I’m already thinking about joining a club or something. I saw a poster for the photography club — I used to take pictures all the time in high school. Maybe I’ll go to their meeting next week. Or maybe I’ll just nap instead.

Speaker 3:  
Do both. Take a nap, then go to the meeting. That’s the college way. Just don’t forget to set an alarm. I set one for my first class and slept through it. I showed up ten minutes late and just kinda slid into my seat like, “Yep, I meant to do that.”

Speaker 1:  
That’s the spirit. I’m just trying to keep it together. I think I’m doing okay. I mean, I haven’t gotten lost in the library yet. That’s a win.

Speaker 2:  
True. And we’re all in this together. If I can survive my first week, I can survive anything. Even stats. Maybe.

Speaker 3:  
Here’s to surviving — and thriving. And maybe, just maybe, finding a nap room someday.
