Speaker 1: So I was walking through campus yesterday and I saw this huge sign, you know, the kind you put in the grass for events. It said “Welcome to UCA” with this fierce bear mascot. I mean, it’s pretty cool, right? I was like, “Whoa, this place is serious about their branding.” And I thought, “Man, I wonder what it’s like for new students coming in.”

Speaker 2: Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I was at a welcome event last week. They had this purple tent set up, and under it, there was a table with donuts and coffee. I mean, who doesn’t love free donuts? There were these two women, probably staff or faculty, handing out info and talking to students. One guy was just grabbing a donut and looking at the map. I felt like I was back in high school all over again, trying to figure out where the cafeteria was.

Speaker 3: That sounds familiar. I remember my first day, I was so overwhelmed. I was sitting in the student center, trying to get my bearings. There were these two girls on this big bench, both on laptops. One had a green one, the other had a purple one. They were both so focused, typing away. I think I was just sitting there, staring at the floor, thinking, “What am I even doing here?” I mean, it’s a big transition, right? One minute you’re in high school, and the next you’re on your own, trying to figure out how to use the campus Wi-Fi.

Speaker 1: Totally. And then I saw this group of three girls outside, laughing and looking at a piece of paper. They were probably trying to figure out their class schedule or maybe a campus map. I think that’s one of the most universal things—everyone’s trying to figure out the same thing. You’re all in the same boat, even if you don’t realize it. I remember feeling so alone, but then I’d see someone else looking lost, and it made me feel a little better. Like, “Hey, I’m not the only one.”

Speaker 2: Exactly. And then there’s the walking across campus part. I saw this group crossing the street, and one girl was wearing a purple shirt with “Bears” on it. I think she was a student ambassador or something. There was a guy in a safety vest, too, probably helping with traffic. It’s funny, because I remember thinking, “Wow, they’re really making an effort to make this feel safe and welcoming.” And I think that’s important. You’re coming from home, and suddenly you’re in this new environment. You need to feel like you belong.

Speaker 3: I think that’s the key—feeling like you belong. I remember my first week, I was so nervous. I didn’t know anyone. I was sitting in my dorm room, trying to figure out how to log into the library system. And then this girl knocks on my door and says, “Hey, I’m from the floor. Do you want to grab coffee?” I was like, “Sure!” And we ended up talking for hours. She told me about all the clubs and events. I think that’s what makes the difference. It’s not just the buildings or the classes—it’s the people.

Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think that’s what the welcome sign is really about. It’s not just “Welcome to UCA,” it’s “Welcome to your new community.” I mean, the bear mascot is fierce, but it’s also kind of protective, you know? Like, “Hey, we’ve got your back.” And that’s what you need when you’re starting something new. You need to know that you’re not alone.

Speaker 2: And it’s not just about the first day, either. I think it’s about the whole experience. Like, I was at the student center the other day, and there was this guy with a backpack, just walking by, probably heading to class. And I saw this other girl walking out of the coffee shop, holding a cup. It’s those little moments—just walking across campus, seeing people go about their day—that make you feel like you’re part of something bigger.

Speaker 3: I think that’s what college is really about. It’s not just about getting a degree. It’s about growing, about finding your people, about figuring out who you are. I mean, I remember my first semester, I was so focused on grades and making sure I was doing everything right. But then I started getting involved in clubs, and I realized, “Hey, I don’t have to be perfect. I just have to be me.”

Speaker 1: And that’s the thing. You’re not supposed to have it all figured out. That’s why they have events and welcome signs and people handing out donuts. It’s to help you feel like you’re not alone. And even if you’re walking across campus by yourself, you’re still part of this big community. You’re part of the UCA family, even if you don’t know it yet.

Speaker 2: Exactly. And I think that’s what makes it so special. You’re not just a student—you’re part of something bigger. You’re part of a legacy. And that bear mascot? He’s not just a logo. He’s a symbol. He’s saying, “You belong here.”

Speaker 3: And you know what? I think that’s what we all need to remember. No matter how lost we feel, no matter how overwhelmed, we’re not alone. We’re part of this community. And that’s what makes it all worth it.
