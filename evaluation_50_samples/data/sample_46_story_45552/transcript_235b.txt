Speaker 1:  
You know, I was thinking the other day—how weird it is that we remember certain moments so clearly, even if they’re tiny. Like, I can still feel the brush of that cheap nail polish on my big toe. My mom used to do my nails while we watched cartoons. She’d get so focused, like she was painting a masterpiece. I’d sit there, legs crossed, trying not to wiggle, even though my foot was itching like crazy.

Speaker 2:  
Oh my god, same. My grandma did my nails too. She had this one bottle of red that smelled like chemicals and strawberries. I’d always beg her to let me pick the color, even though I knew she’d say no. “Red’s classic,” she’d say. “It’s what grown-ups wear.” I’d roll my eyes, but secretly? I loved it. Felt like I was getting a little piece of her world.

Speaker 3:  
That’s so sweet. I remember my dad trying to do my nails once. He was all, “I got this!” and then he spilled the whole bottle on the couch. My mom walked in, saw the mess, and just laughed. He never tried again. But he’d take us to the beach instead. That was his thing. He’d grab our hands and march us straight into the water, no shoes, no towels, just us and the waves.

Speaker 1:  
Wait, was that the same dad who wore those ridiculous floral swim trunks? I swear, I think he had three pairs, all with palm trees on them. He’d walk like he owned the beach, even when the tide was up to his knees. And you two were just holding his hands, trying not to laugh.

Speaker 2:  
Oh, I remember that! He’d always say, “Feel the ocean, kids. It’s alive.” And we’d be like, “Dad, it’s just water.” But then he’d point out crabs or shells or something, and suddenly it was magic. I think that’s why I still love the beach. Not for the sun or the sand, but for the way he made everything feel important.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, and then there was the birthday cake. Remember that one with the princess on top? You blew out the candles so hard, you almost knocked the whole thing over. Mom had to grab it before it hit the floor. And you were so proud, like, “I did it!” Even though you were only four.

Speaker 1:  
I was five, thank you very much. And that cake was the best thing I’d ever tasted. Pink frosting, sprinkles, and that weird little plastic figurine that smelled like plastic but I still wanted to eat. I think I ate half of it before anyone could stop me. Mom was just shaking her head, laughing. “You’re going to be up all night,” she said. And I was.

Speaker 2:  
You were always the wild one. I remember that one time you got mad at me because I wouldn’t share my crayons. You made this face—like, the most intense scowl ever. You were so tiny, but you looked like you were about to declare war. I gave you the red one just to make you stop.

Speaker 3:  
That face! I have a photo of it somewhere. You were wearing that shirt with the dinosaurs on it, and your hair was all messy. You looked like a tiny, furious storm cloud. But then, like, five minutes later, you were laughing at something dumb Dad said, and all was forgiven.

Speaker 1:  
I was a mood ring, okay? One minute I’m mad, the next I’m giggling at Dad’s terrible jokes. He’d say stuff like, “Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to the other side!” And we’d all groan, but then he’d do this weird chicken dance, and we’d be laughing so hard we couldn’t breathe.

Speaker 2:  
He was the worst. And the best. I miss that. Not just the beach or the cake or the nail polish, but the way everything felt like an adventure. Even when we were just sitting on the couch, watching TV, it felt special. Like we were in our own little world.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah. I think that’s what I miss most. Not the big stuff—the vacations or the holidays—but the small moments. Like when Mom would let us stay up late and we’d sneak cookies from the jar. Or when Dad would let us ride in the front seat, even though we weren’t supposed to. Those were the moments that made us feel like we were part of something bigger.

Speaker 1:  
Totally. I think that’s why I still do my nails the same way Mom taught me. I’ll sit down, paint one toe at a time, and just… breathe. It’s like a little ritual. A way to remember her, you know? And sometimes, when I’m at the beach, I’ll look for those little crabs Dad used to point out. It’s silly, but it makes me feel like he’s still there, walking beside me.

Speaker 2:  
I do that too. I’ll catch myself doing something—like humming a song Mom used to sing or making a face Dad would laugh at—and I’ll just stop and smile. It’s like they’re still with us, in the little things. The way we laugh, the way we love, the way we mess up and laugh about it anyway.

Speaker 3:  
That’s the thing, isn’t it? They’re not gone. They’re just… woven into us. In the way we paint our nails, or walk into the ocean, or blow out candles on a cake. They’re in the memories we carry, the stories we tell, the love we give. And that’s enough. More than enough.

Speaker 1:  
Yeah. More than enough.
