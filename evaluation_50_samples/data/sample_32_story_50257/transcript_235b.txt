Speaker 1:  
Okay, so I’m just gonna say it—getting ready for a wedding is chaos. Absolute, beautiful chaos. I mean, one minute you’re in your robe, the next you’re sitting in a chair with rollers in your hair, and your friend’s standing behind you like, “Hold still, I swear I’m not trying to give you a perm.”

Speaker 2:  
Right? And the hair person? She’s got this look like she’s conducting a symphony, but with bobby pins and hairspray. I swear, my hair stylist that day had the energy of a caffeinated conductor. “Left side, lift! Right side, hold!” I was just sitting there thinking, “I hope I don’t end up looking like a poodle.”

Speaker 1:  
Oh my god, I remember that! And then there’s the makeup table—bottles everywhere, brushes sticking out like a mad scientist’s lab. I spilled glitter on my dress before I even put it on. Glitter. On my wedding dress. I was like, “Well, at least it’s sparkly.”

Speaker 2:  
Glitter is forever. You know that, right? I still find it in my car, my purse, my socks. But honestly? It was worth it. The moment you see the bouquet for the first time—it’s like all the stress melts away. Mine was all pink roses and baby’s breath and these little green berries. So elegant. I just stared at it for like five minutes before I even picked it up.

Speaker 1:  
Same. I held mine like it was a baby. Like, “Don’t drop the baby!” And then you look down and realize you’re wearing a dress that cost more than your first car, and you’re just standing there in a hotel room with your best friend and a bag of chips. It’s surreal.

Speaker 2:  
Totally. And then you see your ring. That’s the moment it hits you—like, “Oh. This is real.” I remember holding my hand up, just staring at it. It was so sparkly, and I kept turning it in the light. I was like, “Is this even real? Did I dream this?”

Speaker 1:  
I did that too! I kept looking at it like, “Yep, still there.” And then you look at your grandma, or your mom, or whoever’s there, and they’re just beaming. Like, “My baby’s getting married.” I swear, my grandma cried when she saw me in my dress. She kept saying, “You look just like your mother.”

Speaker 2:  
Oh, that’s sweet. My grandma was the same. She wore this pink dress and had a little rose pinned to her lapel. She looked so proud. And then she ate half a slice of cake before the reception even started. I was like, “Grandma, save some for the guests!”

Speaker 1:  
Haha, mine did that too. She had a fork in one hand and a napkin in the other, ready to go. And then you see your groomsmen—oh my god, the groomsmen. They’re always the comic relief. Mine were in these silver vests, and one of them had a headband on. Like, a literal headband. I was like, “What are you, a tennis player?”

Speaker 2:  
Wait, no way. A headband? At a wedding? That’s amazing. My brother’s best man had this ridiculous tie that kept slipping off his shoulder. He’d adjust it every five seconds. I swear, every time I looked at him, he was fixing his tie. It was like a nervous tic.

Speaker 1:  
Same energy. And then you’re walking down the aisle, and you’re thinking, “Please don’t trip. Please don’t trip.” And then you see your partner, and all the stress just… vanishes. It’s like, “Oh, right. This is why I’m here.”

Speaker 2:  
Exactly. All the chaos, the glitter, the headbands, the spilled makeup—it all just melts away. And then you’re standing there, saying your vows, and you’re like, “This is it. This is the moment I’ve been waiting for.”

Speaker 1:  
And then you’re dancing, and someone’s spilling champagne on the floor, and your shoes are killing you, but you don’t care because you’re laughing so hard. I remember my husband trying to do this fancy dance move and almost falling over. I was like, “Babe, just hold my hand and sway.”

Speaker 2:  
Haha, same. My husband tried to dip me during our first dance, and I almost went down. I was like, “Nope. Not today, Satan.” But it was perfect. Like, even the mess-ups were perfect.

Speaker 1:  
Totally. And then you’re sitting at the reception, eating cake, and you’re just looking around at everyone—your family, your friends, your partner—and you’re like, “I did it. We did it.” It’s such a weird, wonderful feeling.

Speaker 2:  
Yeah. And then you’re back at the hotel, taking off your shoes, and you’re just sitting there, staring at your ring again. Like, “Yep. Still there.” And you’re just so happy you can’t even put it into words.

Speaker 1:  
Exactly. It’s like, all the stress, all the planning, all the glitter—it was all worth it. Because at the end of the day, you’re married. And you’re happy. And that’s all that matters.

Speaker 2:  
Preach. And if you ever need to do it again, I’m here. Just… maybe skip the glitter next time.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. But I’m keeping the headband. For nostalgia.
