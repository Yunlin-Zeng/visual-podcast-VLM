Speaker 1:  
Dude, I still can’t believe you actually wore that glittery green hat. Like, full-on St. Patrick’s Day mode. Was that your costume for the whole night?

Speaker 2:  
Hey, it’s not a costume—it’s a statement. And a tradition. You don’t show up to a pub on St. Paddy’s without at least one ridiculous hat. Plus, look at this little guy I’m holding. He’s my lucky charm. Got him from that gift shop near the station. He’s wearing a tiny white shirt. Very classy.

Speaker 3:  
You’re ridiculous. But also, kind of endearing. I’m just glad you didn’t try to put that hat on me. I draw the line at glitter and felt.

Speaker 1:  
Wait, did you get your face painted too? I swear I saw a shamrock on your cheek in one of the photos. That’s next-level commitment.

Speaker 2:  
Guilty as charged. The bartender’s niece was doing face painting for a quid. I figured, why not? It’s not every day you get a temporary shamrock on your face. Plus, it matched the hat. Coordination is key.

Speaker 3:  
I’m just glad I didn’t get roped into that. I’m more of a “sit back, eat pizza, and pretend I’m not part of the chaos” kind of person. Speaking of which, where’s that pizza box? I think I left it next to the empty pint glasses.

Speaker 1:  
You mean the one with the blue napkins? Yeah, I saw that. You were practically doing a victory lap around the table after finishing that slice. And then you tried to convince us that pineapple on pizza is a crime against humanity.

Speaker 3:  
Because it is! It’s not even a debate. Pineapple belongs in smoothies, not on pizza. I’m sorry, but if you’re going to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day with pizza, at least make it respectable. No fruit involved.

Speaker 2:  
I’m with you on that. But hey, I did see someone order a Hawaiian pizza earlier. They looked... confident. Like they knew something we didn’t.

Speaker 1:  
Confident? More like delusional. But I guess that’s the spirit of the night, right? Everyone’s doing their own thing. Like, remember that guy with the Guinness hat? The one with the two pints on top?

Speaker 2:  
Oh yeah, he was a legend. I think he came in just for the photo op. He was smiling so wide, I thought his face might crack. And then he tried to order a pint while wearing it. The bartender just laughed and said, “You’re gonna need to take that off, mate.”

Speaker 3:  
I’m surprised he didn’t spill anything. That hat looked like it was held together by hope and duct tape. But hey, props for effort. At least he committed.

Speaker 1:  
Commitment is the name of the game. I mean, look at us. We’re all here, eating, drinking, laughing, pretending we’re not going to regret this tomorrow. That’s what St. Patrick’s Day is about, right? Just letting loose and having fun, even if it means wearing ridiculous hats or getting shamrocks painted on your face.

Speaker 2:  
Exactly. And hey, if I’m going to be the guy with the glittery hat and the teddy bear, then so be it. I’m owning it. Besides, I think the teddy bear is the real star here. He’s got more charm than the rest of us combined.

Speaker 3:  
Don’t let the teddy bear hear you say that. He might start demanding a pint of his own. Or worse, he might start judging our pizza choices.

Speaker 1:  
Okay, okay, I’ll give the teddy bear his due. He’s a good sport. But seriously, how did we end up here? I mean, we were just talking about going out for a casual drink, and now we’re in the middle of a full-on pub celebration with face paint and novelty hats.

Speaker 2:  
That’s the magic of St. Patrick’s Day. It sneaks up on you. One minute you’re thinking, “I’ll just have one pint,” and the next thing you know, you’re wearing a green hat and holding a teddy bear like it’s your job.

Speaker 3:  
And let’s not forget the music. I swear, I heard “Whiskey in the Jar” playing at least three times. I think the DJ was on a loop. But hey, it’s all part of the experience. I’m not complaining. I’m just saying, next year, I’m bringing my own hat. And maybe a better pizza.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. But you’re still not allowed to bring pineapple. That’s non-negotiable.

Speaker 2:  
Agreed. Pineapple is banned. But hey, if you want to bring your own teddy bear, I’m all for it. We can have a whole teddy bear parade. Maybe even a hat contest.

Speaker 3:  
A hat contest? You’re insane. But I’m in. Just don’t make me wear glitter. I draw the line at glitter.

Speaker 1:  
Fair enough. No glitter for you. But you’re still going to have to face paint. That’s the rule. No exceptions.

Speaker 2:  
And I’ll be the judge. I’ve got the shamrock on my cheek, so I’m basically an expert now.

Speaker 3:  
You’re ridiculous. But I love it. Here’s to another St. Patrick’s Day, another pub, another ridiculous hat, and another round of pizza—without pineapple.

Speaker 1:  
Cheers to that. And hey, if we’re doing this again next year, I’m bringing my own Guinness hat. Two pints on top, just like the guy in the photo.

Speaker 2:  
You’re on. But don’t forget the teddy bear. He’s part of the crew now.

Speaker 3:  
Fine. But he’s not allowed to judge the pizza. That’s my job.
