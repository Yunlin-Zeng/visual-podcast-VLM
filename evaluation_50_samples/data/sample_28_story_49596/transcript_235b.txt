Speaker 1:  
Man, I still can’t believe we actually pulled that off. Like, we were just winging it the whole time. I swear, half the crowd didn’t even know what the sign said. “Vesfrodrenical incarnations”? Who even made that up?

Speaker 2:  
Dude, that was your genius. You were the one who insisted we needed “a theme” for the protest. I thought you were joking. Then you showed up with that cardboard monstrosity and a Sharpie. I was like, “Okay, we’re either going viral or getting arrested.”

Speaker 3:  
I’m just glad no one actually read it. I mean, “Kisprogrenical Subjugations Ascensions”? That’s not even a word. I think you just mashed up “kiss,” “progeny,” and “ascension” and called it a day.

Speaker 1:  
Hey, it worked! People were laughing, taking pictures, some guy even asked if we were performance artists. That’s a win in my book. Plus, the McDonald’s lights in the background? Perfect aesthetic. Like, corporate dystopia meets absurdist poetry.

Speaker 2:  
You’re giving yourself way too much credit. The real MVP was the guy in the beer mug hat. He showed up outta nowhere, wearing that ridiculous green hat, and just started dancing. That’s what made the whole thing go viral. People love a good hat.

Speaker 3:  
True. That guy was a legend. He had beads, a shirt that said “Jinnes” — which I’m pretty sure is a typo — and he was just vibing like he owned the street. I think he was the only one who actually believed in the protest. Or maybe he just really wanted to be in the photo.

Speaker 1:  
I’m telling you, the energy was electric. You could feel it. Like, we weren’t even protesting anything real, but people acted like we were changing the world. One lady even gave us a high-five and said, “Keep fighting the good fight!” I didn’t have the heart to tell her we were just messing around.

Speaker 2:  
That’s the beauty of it, though. People want to believe in something, even if it’s nonsense. You give them a sign with made-up words and a guy in a beer hat, and suddenly they’re part of a movement. It’s like performance art meets social commentary meets… I don’t know, St. Patrick’s Day.

Speaker 3:  
Speaking of St. Patrick’s Day, remember that party we went to last year? The one where you wore that sweater with the little flower on it? I swear, you looked like you were auditioning for a 90s sitcom.

Speaker 1:  
Hey, that sweater was iconic. And I’ll have you know, I got compliments on it. People said it was “cozy” and “vintage.” Plus, it matched my mood that night. I was feeling… nostalgic.

Speaker 2:  
Nostalgic? You were drunk and trying to convince everyone that “In and Out” was a deep philosophical statement. You kept saying, “It’s about the journey, not the destination.” I think you were just trying to justify why you kept going back to the snack table.

Speaker 3:  
I remember that. You were also the one who started the impromptu dance-off with the guy in the green shirt. I think he was a college student. You two were just… grooving. No music, no rhythm, just pure, unadulterated joy.

Speaker 1:  
That’s called being in the moment. You guys are too caught up in the details. Sometimes you just gotta let go, throw on a sweater, and dance like nobody’s watching. Even if people are watching. Especially if people are watching.

Speaker 2:  
Fair enough. But let’s not forget the time you tried to take a selfie with that couple on the street. You just walked up to them like, “Hey, mind if I photobomb your romantic night?” And they said yes. I still don’t know how you do it.

Speaker 3:  
That was gold. They were all dressed up, probably on a date, and you just slide in there with your big grin and your “I’m here for the vibes” energy. They didn’t even flinch. I think they thought you were part of the street performance.

Speaker 1:  
See? That’s what I’m talking about. Life’s too short to be shy. You gotta be the guy who shows up with a sign full of nonsense, a sweater with a flower, and a smile that says, “Yeah, I’m ridiculous, but at least I’m having fun.”

Speaker 2:  
Alright, alright, you win. You’re the king of spontaneous chaos. But next time, maybe let’s pick a protest theme that actually makes sense. Or at least one that doesn’t sound like a sci-fi novel written by a drunk robot.

Speaker 3:  
Agreed. And maybe we can get the beer hat guy to join us again. He’s the secret ingredient. Without him, we’re just three guys with a cardboard sign and a questionable fashion sense.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. But I’m keeping the sweater. And the sign. And the spirit of absurdity. That’s non-negotiable.
