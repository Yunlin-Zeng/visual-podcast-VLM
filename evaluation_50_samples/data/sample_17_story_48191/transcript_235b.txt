Speaker 1:  
You know, I walked into that room and immediately felt like I was stepping into a community potluck—except instead of casseroles, everyone’s got binders and name tags. I swear, I saw three different people with “CRW” on their shirts. What even is that?

Speaker 2:  
Cannon River Watershed Partnership. It’s a local environmental group. They’ve been around for, like, twenty years. I think they’re celebrating an anniversary? There was a big poster about “CRW120” or something. Honestly, I didn’t catch the exact number, but the vibe was definitely “we’ve been cleaning up this river since your dad was in high school.”

Speaker 3:  
Wait, so you’re telling me that lady with the scarf and the name tag—Leslie, right?—she’s part of that? I talked to her for ten minutes about invasive species and she didn’t even blink. Just nodded and said, “Oh, you’re talking about garlic mustard? Yeah, we’ve got a workday next Saturday if you want to come pull some.”

Speaker 1:  
That’s Leslie. She’s basically the glue. I saw her earlier talking to some guy in a black shirt—he looked like he was trying to figure out how to plug in a projector. She just handed him a power strip and said, “You’re welcome. Now go save the world, or at least the slideshow.”

Speaker 2:  
I love that. She’s got that “I’ve seen it all” energy but still shows up with a smile. I think she’s been with CRW since the beginning. There was a photo on one of the display boards—black and white, old school—with a group of people standing by a riverbank. She was in it, probably in her 30s, holding a clipboard and looking way too serious for a Saturday morning.

Speaker 3:  
I saw that board too. It was next to the one with Beth. She’s the one with the glasses and the black fleece? She was standing there like, “Yes, I’m proud of this, and you should be too.” Her display had newspaper clippings, old photos, even a little timeline. I think she’s the historian of the group. Or maybe the archivist. Either way, she’s got the receipts.

Speaker 1:  
I asked her about the oldest article she had. She pointed to one from 1987—something about a community cleanup that got covered by the local paper. She said, “That was the year we realized we could actually make a difference if we stopped yelling at each other and started picking up trash.” I mean, that’s a good life lesson right there.

Speaker 2:  
Speaking of yelling—did you see the guy in the green shirt? The one with the arms crossed, standing by the projector? He looked like he was about to give a TED Talk on why everyone should care about watershed management. And honestly? He probably should. I caught part of his talk. He was talking about how runoff from farms affects the river, and he didn’t even use a single slide. Just stood there, calm as can be, and dropped knowledge like it was going out of style.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, I think his name’s Mark. He’s the field coordinator or something. I overheard him telling someone that he used to be a teacher, but he got tired of grading papers and decided to grade riverbanks instead. He said, “At least with water quality, you can see the results.”

Speaker 1:  
That’s actually kind of poetic. I’m not sure I’d want to be grading riverbanks, but I respect the commitment. I think I saw him later, sitting at a table with a laptop, talking to some older guy who looked like he’d been coming to these meetings since the 70s. They were both nodding like they were solving world hunger, but it was probably just figuring out where to put the next rain garden.

Speaker 2:  
I think that’s the thing about this group—they don’t just talk about problems. They actually do stuff. I saw a sign-up sheet for volunteer days. There’s one next week to plant native grasses along the riverbank. I’m thinking about going. I mean, I don’t know the first thing about native grasses, but I can hold a shovel, right?

Speaker 3:  
Same. I signed up too. I figured, if Leslie can spend her Saturday pulling garlic mustard, I can at least show up and pretend I know what I’m doing. Plus, they said there’d be snacks. And by snacks, I mean granola bars and lukewarm coffee. But still—snacks.

Speaker 1:  
I’m in. I’ll bring my own coffee. And maybe a pair of gloves. I don’t want to be the person who shows up empty-handed while everyone else is out there saving the ecosystem. I mean, I’m not saying I’m going to become a full-time river warrior, but hey, one weekend at a time, right?

Speaker 2:  
Exactly. And who knows? Maybe by next year, we’ll be the ones standing in front of the display boards, telling new people about the time we planted 500 native grasses and accidentally started a composting revolution. Or at least got really good at identifying invasive species.

Speaker 3:  
I’ll bring the camera. We’re going to need proof that we actually showed up. And maybe a name tag. I think I saw Leslie with a whole box of them. She’s probably got extras. She’s got extras for everything.

Speaker 1:  
True. Leslie’s got extras for everything. Including patience, apparently. I saw her earlier, helping someone figure out how to print a handout. She didn’t even sigh. Just said, “Here, let me show you,” and fixed it in two seconds. I think she’s secretly a wizard.

Speaker 2:  
Or just really, really good at her job. Either way, I’m glad she’s there. I don’t think I’d have signed up for anything if I hadn’t talked to her. She’s got this way of making you feel like you’re part of something bigger—even if you’re just there for the snacks.

Speaker 3:  
Same. And honestly? I think that’s the whole point. It’s not about being an expert. It’s about showing up. Even if you’re just there to hold a shovel or hand out flyers, you’re still part of the team. And that’s kind of beautiful, you know?

Speaker 1:  
Yeah. It’s like… community, but with more mud and fewer awkward small talk moments. I’ll take it.
