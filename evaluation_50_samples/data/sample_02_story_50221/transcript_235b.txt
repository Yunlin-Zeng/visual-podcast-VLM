Speaker 1:  
You know, I used to think wedding planning was just about picking a dress and a venue. But man, it’s like running a small business with glitter and stress.

Speaker 2:  
Tell me about it. I spent three nights in a row cutting out tiny paper flowers because I was convinced they’d look better than the store-bought ones. Spoiler: they didn’t. But I had fun.

Speaker 3:  
I was the one who tried to make the cake topper out of actual wood slices. Like, real tree rings and everything. I thought it’d be rustic and romantic. What I didn’t realize was that sanding wood in your kitchen at 10 p.m. is not exactly romantic.

Speaker 1:  
Wait, you made the cake topper? That’s the one with the “R & S” and the date burned into it? That’s gorgeous. I thought it was from Etsy.

Speaker 3:  
Thanks! It was a disaster at first. I burned the letters too deep on the first try and it looked like a campfire accident. Then I had to buy a whole new slice and start over. My hands were covered in wood dust for a week.

Speaker 2:  
That’s nothing. I tried to make the invitations by hand. Glitter, stamps, ribbon—everything. I ended up with glitter in my hair, my socks, and somehow even in my coffee. My partner walked in and said, “Are you trying to summon a fairy or just ruin our kitchen?”

Speaker 1:  
I love that. I was the one who tried to DIY the seating chart. I bought these little wooden letters and glued them onto wood slices like you did, but mine kept falling off. I ended up using hot glue and duct tape. It held, but it looked like a craft project from a middle schooler.

Speaker 3:  
You know what’s wild? We all did this stuff separately, but somehow it all came together. Like, the cake topper, the invitations, the seating chart—they all had that same handmade, slightly chaotic vibe. It made the whole thing feel personal.

Speaker 2:  
Totally. And honestly, that’s what people remembered. Not the perfect table settings or the fancy centerpieces. It was the little things—like the fact that the cake topper was made from a tree that grew in your backyard, or that the invitations had your fingerprints on them.

Speaker 1:  
Yeah, and the fact that we all had moments where we were like, “Why am I doing this? I could just buy it.” But then we’d remember why. It wasn’t about perfection. It was about putting a piece of ourselves into it.

Speaker 3:  
Exactly. Like, when I was sanding that wood slice, I was thinking about how this was going to be the centerpiece of our wedding cake. It was going to be there when we cut the cake together, when we danced, when we laughed with our friends. It wasn’t just wood. It was a symbol.

Speaker 2:  
I get that. When I was gluing those paper flowers, I was thinking about how each one represented a little bit of love. Corny, I know, but it felt real. And when I finally finished, I cried. Not because it was perfect, but because I’d done it. All by myself.

Speaker 1:  
Same. I remember sitting at my desk, surrounded by glue sticks and ribbon, and thinking, “This is what love looks like.” Messy, imperfect, but full of heart.

Speaker 3:  
And now, looking back, I wouldn’t change a thing. Even the glitter in the coffee. Even the wood dust in my hair. Even the fact that I almost set the kitchen on fire with that wood-burning tool.

Speaker 2:  
Same. I still have a jar of glitter in my closet. I can’t bring myself to throw it away. It’s like a trophy now. A reminder of what we accomplished.

Speaker 1:  
I keep the seating chart. It’s hanging in our living room. Every time I look at it, I remember how stressed I was, but also how proud I felt when it was done. It’s not perfect, but it’s ours.

Speaker 3:  
That’s the thing, isn’t it? It’s not about doing everything right. It’s about doing it with love. And maybe a little bit of glue.

Speaker 2:  
And glitter. Don’t forget the glitter.

Speaker 1:  
Never. Glitter is forever.

Speaker 3:  
I think we should do another project together. Maybe a Christmas ornament or something. Something small, but meaningful.

Speaker 2:  
I’m in. But next time, let’s agree on one thing: no glitter in the kitchen.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. But I’m still bringing the glue sticks.

Speaker 3:  
And I’ll bring the wood slices. Just don’t ask me to burn anything this time.

Speaker 2:  
Fair enough. We’ll stick to painting. Or maybe just assembling. I’m good with assembling.

Speaker 1:  
As long as we’re doing it together, I’m good with anything.

Speaker 3:  
Same here. Because at the end of the day, it’s not about the project. It’s about the people.

Speaker 2:  
And the memories. And the glitter. Always the glitter.

Speaker 1:  
Always.
