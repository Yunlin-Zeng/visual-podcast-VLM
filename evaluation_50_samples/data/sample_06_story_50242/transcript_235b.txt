Speaker 1:  
Alright, so I’m still trying to process how we ended up at a wedding in a courtroom. Like, seriously? Was that even legal? I mean, the wood paneling, the chandeliers, the judge’s bench with the green curtain behind it — it felt like we were about to get sentenced, not celebrate.

Speaker 2:  
It was totally legal! The registrar was legit. And honestly? It was kind of brilliant. No boring church, no awkward hymns — just a really elegant room with a weirdly regal vibe. Plus, the lighting? Chef’s kiss. You could see every detail — the flowers, the hats, even the guy in the front row trying to sneak a selfie with his phone.

Speaker 3:  
That guy was me. And I got a solid shot of the bride walking in. She looked amazing. That veil, the dress — it was like she stepped out of a vintage magazine. And the groom? He was beaming. You could tell he was trying not to cry, but his eyes were definitely glistening.

Speaker 4:  
I think everyone was trying not to cry. Even the guy with the mustache who was sitting next to me — he was wiping his eyes with his napkin. And then he started recording the whole thing on his phone like he was making a documentary. I swear, I thought he was going to stand up and yell “Objection!” halfway through.

Speaker 1:  
Honestly, I think that would’ve been the highlight. “Objection! The groom is too handsome!” But seriously, the whole thing was so… intentional. Like, they didn’t just pick a venue — they curated an experience. Even the reception was a vibe. That checkered tablecloth? The Union Jack bunting? It was like a British garden party meets a hipster wedding.

Speaker 2:  
And don’t even get me started on the food. I mean, I was expecting a few sandwiches and some cheap wine, but no — they had this whole spread. Cheese boards, little sandwiches, and then the cupcakes. Oh my god, the cupcakes. They were stacked on these tiered stands like they were in a fancy bakery window. Chocolate, vanilla, pink swirls — I think I had three.

Speaker 3:  
You had five. I counted. And you were trying to be sneaky about it, but I saw you sneak back for that chocolate one with the pink frosting. You’re lucky the bride didn’t catch you — she was busy trying to keep her veil from getting caught in her chair.

Speaker 4:  
That veil was a menace. I saw her trying to adjust it while she was talking to the guests. And then there was that moment when she was standing by the window, and the light hit her just right — it was like a movie scene. I actually stopped eating for a second to take it in.

Speaker 1:  
Same. I think we all did. It was one of those moments where you just pause and think, “This is why we do this.” You know? Weddings are weird — they’re this mix of chaos and beauty, and somehow it all comes together. Like, one minute you’re laughing at the groom’s terrible tie, and the next you’re tearing up because he’s saying his vows.

Speaker 2:  
And let’s not forget the groom’s speech. I mean, he started off with a joke about how he used to think marriage was just a legal contract, and then he got all serious and said, “But now I know it’s about choosing to be happy with the same person every day.” I swear, I choked on my wine.

Speaker 3:  
I think half the room choked on their wine. And then the best man had to step in and say, “Alright, enough of that — let’s get back to the cake!” Which, by the way, was also amazing. It was this three-tiered thing with buttercream flowers, and they cut it with this giant knife that looked like it belonged in a medieval castle.

Speaker 4:  
I was waiting for someone to accidentally stab themselves with it. But nope — everyone was surprisingly coordinated. Even the little girl in the pink dress who was sitting next to me — she was eating her cake like a pro. No mess, no spills, just pure focus.

Speaker 1:  
That kid was a legend. I think she’s going to be a wedding planner one day. She had the whole thing figured out — where to sit, what to eat, when to smile for the camera. I was just trying not to spill my drink on my suit.

Speaker 2:  
You did spill your drink on your suit. Twice. But hey, at least you looked good doing it. And honestly, that’s what weddings are about — looking good while you’re making a mess. It’s like a rite of passage.

Speaker 3:  
I think the real rite of passage was surviving the group photo. I swear, we must’ve taken 20 pictures before everyone was smiling at the same time. And then the photographer had to yell, “Okay, now look natural!” Which is the most unnatural thing you can say to a group of people.

Speaker 4:  
But we pulled it off. And now we have these amazing photos to prove it. I mean, I’ve already sent them to my mom, and she’s already planning her own wedding based on this one. She wants the courtroom, the cupcakes, the checkered tablecloths — the whole shebang.

Speaker 1:  
Tell her to add the mustache guy with the phone. He’s a must-have. And maybe the little girl in the pink dress — she’s the real MVP.

Speaker 2:  
Agreed. And hey, if we’re lucky, maybe we’ll get invited to the next one. I hear they’re thinking about doing it on a boat. With fireworks. And more cupcakes.

Speaker 3:  
I’m already packing my bag.
