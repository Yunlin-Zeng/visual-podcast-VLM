Speaker 1: So I was looking through some old photos from that event last year, and I came across this one. It’s David Carter and Wayne Flynt sitting together at a table. David’s got that big smile, and Wayne’s just looking so... warm. I remember Wayne saying something about how much he appreciated the chance to connect with younger scholars. He’s always been such a mentor figure, you know?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I remember that. Wayne’s presence at those gatherings was always something special. He’d sit there, maybe with a cup of coffee, and just listen—really listen—to what the younger folks had to say. He didn’t need to dominate the conversation. He’d just be there, offering quiet wisdom. And David, he’s so passionate about his work. I can see that in his eyes even in the photo. He’s clearly excited to be there, to be part of the conversation.

Speaker 3: I think what stood out to me was how different their styles were, but how well they complemented each other. David’s energy is so vibrant, and Wayne’s is so grounded. I remember sitting near them during the luncheon. There was this moment when David was talking about a new project he was working on, and Wayne just leaned in, asked a thoughtful question. It wasn’t about correcting him or steering the conversation—it was about genuinely engaging. That’s the kind of mentorship that sticks with you.

Speaker 1: Exactly. And look at this other photo—Wayne’s with Paul, and David’s there too. It’s like a little academic family portrait. I love how they’re all just standing there, relaxed, smiling. You can tell they’re not just colleagues; they’re friends. Paul’s always been the quiet observer, but he’s so insightful. I remember one time he said something during a panel that just changed the way I thought about the topic. He doesn’t say much, but when he does, it’s gold.

Speaker 2: Speaking of panels, I was thinking about that presentation Frank Chandler gave. He was at the podium, and he had this intensity, this focus. You could tell he was passionate about what he was saying. But there was also this calmness to him. He wasn’t shouting or gesturing wildly—he just spoke with conviction. I think that’s what made his talk so powerful. He didn’t need drama to make his point. He just needed to be honest and clear.

Speaker 3: I was sitting in the back during that session, and I could see how the audience was leaning in. There was this stillness in the room. Everyone was listening. I think that’s the mark of a great speaker—not just someone who has something to say, but someone who knows how to say it in a way that makes people pay attention. Frank’s got that gift. And I remember after the talk, he came over to the table where we were sitting and asked us what we thought. He wasn’t just waiting for applause—he wanted real feedback.

Speaker 1: That’s so true. And it’s not just Frank. Look at the wider shots of the event. There’s this energy in the room—people talking, laughing, sharing food. It’s not just a conference. It’s a community. I remember sitting at a table with a group of people I’d never met before, and we ended up talking for hours. About history, sure, but also about family, about life. That’s what makes these events so special. It’s not just about the papers or the presentations. It’s about the connections.

Speaker 2: And the food! I mean, who knew a simple luncheon could be so meaningful? There were these little cupcakes on the table, and someone brought a salad, and there was this vase of pink tulips in the center. It felt like a celebration. Not just of scholarship, but of people. Of being together. I think that’s what Wayne would have wanted. He always said that history isn’t just about facts and dates—it’s about people. And stories. And relationships.

Speaker 3: I think that’s why the event was so impactful. It wasn’t just a gathering of academics. It was a gathering of people who care. Who care about each other, and who care about the work they do. And when you put that together—passion, mentorship, community—it creates something really powerful. I remember leaving that day feeling inspired. Not just by what I’d learned, but by who I’d been with.

Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think that’s the legacy of people like Wayne and Frank and David. They don’t just teach us history. They teach us how to be better scholars, sure, but also how to be better people. How to listen. How to engage. How to care. That’s what I’ll remember most about that day—the faces, the laughter, the quiet moments of connection. That’s what makes it real.

Speaker 2: And I think that’s what keeps us coming back. Not just for the content, but for the community. For the chance to sit at a table with someone like Wayne and hear him say, “Tell me more.” That’s the kind of invitation that changes lives. And I’m so grateful we had that moment.
