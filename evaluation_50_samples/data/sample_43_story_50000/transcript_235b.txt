Speaker 1:  
You know, I still can’t believe we’re all here again. Feels like just yesterday we were sitting in that same gym, arguing about the best way to format the newsletter.

Speaker 2:  
Oh, don’t remind me. I swear, Frank, you and your “typography is everything” rants nearly started a mutiny. But hey, look at us now—still arguing, but at least we’re doing it over cupcakes and salad.

Speaker 3:  
Speaking of salad, did you see the one on the table with the tulips? Someone went all out. I mean, pink tulips? In February? That’s commitment.

Speaker 4:  
Commitment or desperation. I think Martha from accounting just wanted to distract us from the fact that the pasta was slightly undercooked again. But hey, we’re not here for gourmet cuisine. We’re here for the people.

Speaker 5:  
And the speeches. Don’t forget the speeches. Frank, you were on fire up there. I swear, when you started talking about the 1988 budget crisis, I saw Paul actually lean forward. That’s a miracle.

Speaker 6:  
Hey, I’ll take it. Paul’s been known to nap through the best of them. But seriously, it’s wild how much has changed—and how much hasn’t. I mean, look around. Same faces, same chairs, same slightly-too-small gymnasium.

Speaker 1:  
Except now we’ve got a projector. Remember when we used to have to haul in that giant overhead? And the chalkboard? God, the chalkboard. I still have dust in my lungs from that thing.

Speaker 2:  
And the handprints on the curtain? That’s still there. I swear, that’s been hanging since the Reagan administration. I think it’s a monument now.

Speaker 3:  
It’s a relic. A beautiful, slightly dusty relic. Like us.

Speaker 4:  
Hey, I’ll take “relic” over “retired.” We’re not done yet. Not by a long shot. I mean, look at Wayne. He’s got more energy than half the people here. And he’s probably the oldest person in the room.

Speaker 5:  
Don’t let him hear you say that. He’ll challenge you to a game of basketball. He still thinks he’s got it.

Speaker 6:  
He does have it. I saw him last week at the community center. Dribbling like he was twenty again. And he still wears that sweater vest. I don’t know how he does it.

Speaker 1:  
It’s the confidence. That’s what it is. You wear a sweater vest like that, you’re making a statement. “I’m here, I’m comfortable, and I’m not apologizing for it.”

Speaker 2:  
I think I need to start wearing sweater vests. Maybe it’ll give me that kind of mojo.

Speaker 3:  
Good luck with that. You’d look like a librarian who got lost on the way to a frat party.

Speaker 4:  
Ouch. But fair. I’ll stick to my red vest. It’s got flair. And it hides the fact that I spilled spaghetti sauce on my shirt earlier.

Speaker 5:  
You did not. I was sitting right next to you. You were eating salad.

Speaker 4:  
Exactly. The salad had dressing. And I’m not great with forks.

Speaker 6:  
We’ve all been there. Remember that time David tried to eat a cupcake with a knife and fork? Looked like he was performing surgery.

Speaker 1:  
He was. He said he was “honoring the dessert.” I think he just didn’t want to get his hands dirty.

Speaker 2:  
David’s always been a little… particular. But hey, he’s still here. Still smiling. Still wearing that ridiculous tie.

Speaker 3:  
It’s not ridiculous. It’s vintage. And it’s got character. Like him.

Speaker 4:  
Fair. I’ll give him that. He’s got more character than most people I know. And he’s still got that same name tag. “David Carter.” Like he’s afraid we’ll forget who he is.

Speaker 5:  
We wouldn’t forget him. He’s the guy who organized the first reunion. Remember? He sent out those handwritten letters. No email. No text. Just pen and paper.

Speaker 6:  
And stamps. He spent a fortune on stamps. But it worked. Look at us. We’re all here because of him.

Speaker 1:  
And because of Wayne. He’s the glue. Always has been. Even when he’s telling that same story about the snowstorm in ’92 for the hundredth time.

Speaker 2:  
I don’t mind. It’s comforting. Like a warm blanket. Or a really good cup of coffee.

Speaker 3:  
Speaking of coffee, did anyone see where they put the coffee station? I’m running on fumes here.

Speaker 4:  
It’s by the door. Next to the basket of muffins. And the sign that says “Please don’t take more than one.”

Speaker 5:  
Yeah, like anyone listens to that. I saw Paul grab three. And he’s not even a coffee guy.

Speaker 6:  
He’s a muffin guy. Always has been. I think he comes for the muffins and stays for the company.

Speaker 1:  
Same here. Honestly, I’d come even if they served cold cereal. It’s not about the food. It’s about being here. Together.

Speaker 2:  
Amen to that. Here’s to another year. And another reunion. And maybe, just maybe, a new curtain.

Speaker 3:  
Don’t hold your breath. That handprint curtain is staying. It’s part of the tradition.

Speaker 4:  
Then let’s make sure we add to it. Next year, I’m bringing my kids. They need to see where their dad came from.

Speaker 5:  
And I’ll bring my grandkids. They need to know where their grandma got her sass.

Speaker 6:  
And I’ll bring my dog. He’s a good listener. And he doesn’t care if the pasta’s undercooked.

Speaker 1:  
Perfect. Then it’s settled. Same time next year. Same gym. Same handprint curtain. And hopefully, better pasta.

Speaker 2:  
Deal. Now, who’s up for another cupcake? I think I saw a blue one with sprinkles.

Speaker 3:  
I’m in. But only if you promise not to eat it with a knife and fork.

Speaker 4:  
No promises. But I’ll try. For the sake of tradition.
