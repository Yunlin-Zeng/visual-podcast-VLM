Speaker 1:  
Man, I still can’t believe we actually made it to Niddal Hole Point. I mean, the drive was insane—winding roads, mist everywhere, and then suddenly… this.

Speaker 2:  
Right? It’s like the whole valley just opens up in front of you. That river snaking through the hills? I swear I could’ve stared at it for hours. And the fog—it wasn’t even annoying. It made everything look… mystical, you know?

Speaker 3:  
Mystical is one word for it. I’d say “dramatic.” Like, one minute you’re squinting through mist, next you’re seeing this massive green landscape with water cutting right through it. And those terraced fields? I didn’t even know places like this still existed outside of postcards.

Speaker 1:  
Totally. And then we turned a corner and—bam—there’s this waterfall just pouring off the cliff. No warning. Just pure, raw nature. I swear, I could hear it before I even saw it. That roar? It’s like the earth’s own soundtrack.

Speaker 2:  
Yeah, and the moss! The whole cliff was covered in this bright green moss, like velvet. I kept thinking, “How is this even real?” It looked like something out of a fantasy movie. And the water—so clear and forceful. You could feel the spray from halfway down the trail.

Speaker 3:  
I tried to get a good photo, but my phone just couldn’t capture it. The mist kept getting in the way, and then the wind would blow my hair into my face. But honestly? I’m kinda glad. Sometimes it’s better to just… be there, you know? No filters, no editing—just you, the sound, the smell of wet earth and greenery.

Speaker 1:  
Same. I put my phone away after the first five minutes. Just sat on a rock, watched the water fall, and let my brain reset. It’s crazy how something so simple can feel so… grounding.

Speaker 2:  
Grounding is the word. And then we stumbled on those horses. I mean, what are the odds? Two beautiful horses just standing there, being brushed by these local guys. That black-and-white one? Looked like it was posing for a movie.

Speaker 3:  
Oh my god, yes! The white one was so calm, just standing there like, “Yeah, I’m used to this.” And the guy with the striped shirt? He was so gentle with the black one. I swear, I wanted to just hop on and ride off into the mist.

Speaker 1:  
Ride off into the mist? That’s literally what I was thinking. But then I remembered I haven’t ridden a horse since I was, like, eight. And that ended with me falling off into a pile of hay. So… maybe next time.

Speaker 2:  
Next time, we bring helmets. And maybe a picnic. I saw a little clearing near the waterfall that looked perfect for lunch. Imagine eating sandwiches while watching water crash down. That’s the dream.

Speaker 3:  
Dream? More like a lifestyle. I’m already planning our next trip. We need to come back in the dry season—see the same views without the mist. I bet the colors are even more insane when the sun’s out.

Speaker 1:  
True. But I kinda love the mist. It made everything feel… softer. Like the world was wrapped in a blanket. And the sign? “Niddal Hole Point.” I kept laughing because it sounds like a bad joke. “Hey, wanna go to Niddal Hole?” “Sure, why not?”

Speaker 2:  
It’s got character, though. That sign’s been through some weather. Scratched up, faded, but still standing. Kinda like us after that hike. We’re battered, but we made it.

Speaker 3:  
Battered but victorious. And speaking of victories—I need to give a shout-out to Priya. That woman? She was beaming the whole time. Like, wind in her hair, glasses slightly crooked, just… radiating joy. I took a photo of her, and she looked like she belonged in that landscape. Like she was part of it.

Speaker 1:  
Oh, absolutely. She was practically glowing. I think she’s the reason we didn’t turn back when the trail got muddy. She just kept saying, “It’s worth it, trust me!” And she was right. Every step.

Speaker 2:  
She’s got that energy, you know? Like, she doesn’t just visit places—she absorbs them. I saw her just standing at the edge, eyes closed, breathing it all in. I think she was communing with the valley.

Speaker 3:  
Communing? Yeah, that’s the word. And honestly? I think we all did, in our own way. Even if I was mostly thinking about how hungry I was. But still—there’s something about being that high up, surrounded by green, with water rushing below… it just… shifts you.

Speaker 1:  
Yeah. It’s not just a view. It’s a feeling. Like you’re small, but in a good way. Like the world’s big and wild and beautiful, and you’re lucky enough to be standing in it.

Speaker 2:  
Exactly. And we didn’t even plan any of this. It was all just… serendipity. The mist, the waterfall, the horses, the sign, Priya’s smile… it all came together. Sometimes the best trips are the ones you don’t overthink.

Speaker 3:  
Agreed. Next time, we do less planning. More wandering. More getting lost. More letting the landscape surprise us.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. And next time, we bring snacks. Because I’m still hungry.

Speaker 2:  
And more water. I swear, I drank half my bottle just from the mist alone.

Speaker 3:  
And maybe a horse. Just one. For dramatic effect.

Speaker 1:  
Done. Let’s make it a white one. With a flowing mane. And we’ll ride it into the sunset. Or the mist. Whichever comes first.

Speaker 2:  
Perfect. I’ll bring the camera. And the picnic. And maybe a helmet… just in case.

Speaker 3:  
And I’ll bring the joy. Because after today? I’ve got plenty to spare.
