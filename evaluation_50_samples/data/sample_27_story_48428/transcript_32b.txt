Speaker 1: So we're in the hills, right? And it's just... it's just so green. Like, I mean, I know it's monsoon season, but I didn't expect it to be this lush. It's like the whole place is breathing.

Speaker 2: Absolutely. It's like nature's been given a full-on spa day. You can feel the humidity, the air’s thick with moisture. And look at that river down there—snaking through the valley like a silver ribbon. I swear, from up here, it looks like a giant’s toy.

Speaker 3: I mean, I’ve seen rivers before, but never like this. The way it cuts through the green... it’s like the land is holding its breath. And the mist? It’s like the mountains are exhaling slowly. It’s so peaceful.

Speaker 1: It’s quiet too. Not a single car horn, no traffic. Just the wind, maybe some birds. It’s like the world slowed down. I feel like I could just sit here forever and watch the clouds roll over the hills.

Speaker 2: That’s the thing, right? You’re not just *seeing* the landscape—you’re *feeling* it. The air, the smell of wet earth, the way the light changes when the mist lifts for a second. It’s like you’re inside a painting.

Speaker 3: And then you get to the waterfall. Oh my god, the waterfall. It’s not huge, but it’s... alive. Like it’s not just water falling—it’s the rock singing. The moss, the green clinging to every inch of that cliff. It’s like the mountain is wearing a fur coat made of plants.

Speaker 1: I was actually thinking—how does that much water even get up there? Like, what’s feeding it? Is it just the rain, or is there a spring or something hidden?

Speaker 2: Probably a combination. The monsoon rains saturate the ground, and then the water finds its way through cracks in the rock. And over time, it carves out this path. It’s not just water—it’s time. Thousands of years of water carving its way down.

Speaker 3: And you know what’s wild? The way the water hits the rocks at the bottom. It’s not just noise—it’s a rhythm. Like a drumbeat. And the mist rising from it... you can feel it on your skin. It’s like standing in a cloud.

Speaker 1: I was actually thinking about that sign we saw earlier—the “Niddal Hole Point.” I don’t even know what that means. Is it a local name? A landmark?

Speaker 2: Yeah, I think it’s a local spot. Maybe a viewpoint or a trailhead. The sign’s kind of beat up, covered in graffiti. But it’s green, which fits the vibe. I mean, it’s not exactly polished tourism. It’s raw. Real.

Speaker 3: And then you see the horses. I mean, who brings horses up here? It’s not like there’s a trail for riding, right?

Speaker 1: Well, maybe there is. Or maybe they’re just used for transport. Look at them—so calm. That black and white one, with the man holding it... he’s not even trying to control it. It’s like they’re just... hanging out. Like this is their backyard.

Speaker 2: And the guy in the green shirt, he’s just standing there, looking out. Not posing. Not trying to be cool. Just... being. It’s so different from back home, where everything’s rushed, everyone’s on their phone. Here, it’s like time doesn’t exist.

Speaker 3: That’s what I love about it. It’s not about being somewhere—it’s about *being*. Like, when you’re standing there, with the wind in your hair and the green all around, you just... stop. You’re not thinking about work, or bills, or what’s next. You’re just *here*.

Speaker 1: And that’s when you see things you wouldn’t otherwise. Like that woman we took a photo of—she’s smiling, but it’s not a posed smile. It’s like she’s laughing at the wind, or maybe at something funny she just thought of. And her hair’s flying, like she’s dancing with the air.

Speaker 2: That’s the thing—when you’re in nature, you’re not pretending. You’re not filtering. You just... are. And that’s rare. That’s beautiful.

Speaker 3: I mean, I’ve been to mountains before, but never felt this... connected. Like the air, the water, the earth—they’re all talking to you. And you’re not just listening. You’re part of the conversation.

Speaker 1: And you know what’s funny? I didn’t even realize how much I needed this until I got here. Like, I came for a break, but I didn’t know how broken I was. The city’s loud, it’s fast, it’s... artificial. But here? It’s real. It’s messy. It’s wet. It’s green. And it’s healing.

Speaker 2: Exactly. It’s not about fixing anything. It’s about remembering. Remembering that we’re part of something bigger. That we’re not separate from the world—we’re in it. We’re breathing the same air, drinking the same water, standing on the same soil.

Speaker 3: And that’s why I think places like this matter. Not because they’re “pretty” or “scenic.” But because they remind us to slow down. To breathe. To smile at the wind. To just... be.

Speaker 1: And maybe that’s the real magic. Not the waterfall, not the view, not even the horses. It’s the quiet. The stillness. The way the world doesn’t need to rush to be beautiful.

Speaker 2: Yeah. And when you leave... you carry it with you. Not as a memory, but as a feeling. Like you’ve been touched by something that doesn’t need words.

Speaker 3: So next time someone says, “Why go to the hills?” I’ll say: “Because sometimes, you need to remember how to breathe.”
