Speaker 1:  
Dude, I still can’t believe we went full-on horror movie night last year. Like, not just costumes—full immersion. I swear, my Freddy Krueger sweater got more compliments than my actual wardrobe this year.

Speaker 2:  
Right? And you had that little flower pinned to your chest like it was some kind of macabre boutonniere. I thought it was genius. Like, “Hey, I’m here to murder you… but also, I appreciate autumnal florals.”

Speaker 1:  
Hey, don’t knock it. It was a statement. And you? You showed up looking like a goth fairy godmother with that claw glove and the bouquet of dying roses. You were basically the villain’s tragic love interest.

Speaker 2:  
I mean, I was going for “haunted garden party,” but yeah, I’ll take tragic love interest. Bonus points for the tongue piercing—I think it made me look extra dangerous. Or extra confused. Hard to tell.

Speaker 3:  
Wait, you guys were the ones who showed up with the bat backdrop and the wooden prop tree? That was you? I thought that was part of the venue’s decor!

Speaker 1:  
Nah, that was us. We brought the whole setup. My cousin’s into DIY haunted houses. We just borrowed his “spooky forest” corner. And honestly? It was the only part of the party that didn’t look like a college dorm room with streamers.

Speaker 2:  
Don’t forget the pumpkin. That one was real. We carved it, lit it, and then someone knocked it over. It was a casualty of the night. RIP pumpkin.

Speaker 3:  
Okay, but the real MVP of that night was the guy dressed as a priest with the sunglasses and the soda. What was his deal?

Speaker 1:  
Oh, that’s Dave. He showed up as “The Exorcist meets Miami Vice.” He had the white robe, the sunglasses, the cigarette, the soda—he was basically a walking meme. And he was the only one who brought his own drink. Classy.

Speaker 2:  
He also tried to “bless” everyone with his soda can. I think he said, “May the caffeine be with you.” It was weirdly touching.

Speaker 3:  
And then there was the woman in the black veil with the gold trim. She looked like she stepped out of a 1920s silent film noir. Was that your friend?

Speaker 2:  
That was Marla. She’s always going for the dramatic. She showed up with fishnets and thigh-high boots under that robe. Said she was “a mourning widow with a secret.” I think the secret was that she was just really into the drama.

Speaker 1:  
She did look amazing. And then she got kissed by the guy in the lab coat. That was wild.

Speaker 3:  
Wait, the lab coat guy? Was that the one with the glasses and the messy hair? He looked like a mad scientist who forgot to comb his hair.

Speaker 2:  
That’s him. He was supposed to be Dr. Frankenstein, but he kept calling himself “Dr. Frank.” He was super into it. And then he kissed Marla right in the middle of the party. Everyone just froze.

Speaker 1:  
I think we all collectively gasped. It was like a movie moment. And then someone yelled, “Kiss her again!” and he did. Twice. It was weirdly romantic.

Speaker 3:  
Okay, but what about the Marilyn Monroe and the woman in the black dress? That was a whole other vibe.

Speaker 2:  
Oh, that was my sister and her friend. My sister went as Marilyn—full blonde wig, white dress, the whole thing. And her friend went as… I think she said she was “a sophisticated lady from the 1950s.” She had the tiara, the pearls, the black dress. Very elegant.

Speaker 1:  
They were the only ones who looked like they belonged at a fancy dinner party instead of a horror-themed rave. I think they were just there for the snacks.

Speaker 3:  
Fair. But they did look stunning. And I love how they just posed like they were on a red carpet. No one else was even trying that hard.

Speaker 2:  
Yeah, everyone else was either covered in fake blood or trying to look like they’d just escaped a haunted house. It was chaos.

Speaker 1:  
And then there was the group shot. That was the highlight. We all crammed into one frame like we were a weird family portrait. The guy with the hat and the striped shirt, the woman in the veil, the mad scientist, the priest with the soda, the Marilyn Monroe duo… it was a masterpiece.

Speaker 3:  
I still have that photo on my fridge. It’s my go-to “remember when we were young and ridiculous” reminder.

Speaker 2:  
Same. And I swear, every time I look at it, I notice something new. Like, the guy in the back with the red hair? He’s wearing a scarf that looks like it’s made of snakes. I didn’t even notice that until last week.

Speaker 1:  
That’s the beauty of it. It’s not just a photo—it’s a time capsule. A chaotic, ridiculous, slightly terrifying time capsule.

Speaker 3:  
Next year, we’re doing a theme. No more “whatever you find in your closet.” I’m thinking “decades.” Everyone has to pick a decade and go all out.

Speaker 2:  
I’m in. I’m going full 1920s flapper. Feathers, fringe, and a headband that says “I’m here for the jazz.”

Speaker 1:  
I’m doing 1980s. Big hair, neon, and a boombox. I’ll even wear leg warmers if I have to.

Speaker 3:  
And I’m going 1950s. Think poodle skirts, saddle shoes, and a milkshake. I’ll even learn how to do the twist.

Speaker 2:  
This is going to be amazing. Or a disaster. Either way, I’m bringing the camera.

Speaker 1:  
And I’m bringing the snacks. Because no matter what decade we’re in, we’re still going to need snacks.

Speaker 3:  
Deal. And next year, we’re making sure the pumpkin survives.
