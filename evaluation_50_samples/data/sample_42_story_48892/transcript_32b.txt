Speaker 1: So I was looking through some old photos the other day, and I came across these shots from a protest march I went to back in 2003. I remember it like it was yesterday. The air was thick with tension, and the streets were packed. It was one of those days where you could feel the collective heartbeat of a city, maybe even a country, pulsing with dissent.

Speaker 2: 2003? That’s right around the time of the Iraq War buildup, isn’t it? I remember that period. There was so much fear and uncertainty. People were genuinely worried about what was going to happen. I think that’s what made the protests so powerful — they weren’t just about politics; they were about human fear and hope.

Speaker 3: Exactly. I was there too. I remember standing on that bridge, looking down at the sea of people. It was overwhelming. You could see banners and signs from every direction. There was this one sign that stood out — “Quelle CONNERIE La GUERRE” — which is French for “What a mess, war.” It was so simple, yet so profound. It cut through all the political noise and got straight to the heart of it: war is just nonsense.

Speaker 1: Yeah, that sign really stuck with me. And then there was the one that said “Bomb from 50,000 feet — inspire terrorism!” That one was particularly sharp. It was a direct challenge to the logic of the war. If you’re bombing from high up, you’re not targeting specific people — you’re targeting neighborhoods, cities, civilians. And that’s not just collateral damage; that’s a recipe for more hatred, more extremism.

Speaker 2: That’s a crucial point. The idea that military action can solve a problem like terrorism is so flawed. It’s like trying to put out a fire with gasoline. You’re only fueling the flames. And I remember seeing a sign that said “War is pants” — someone had actually made a pair of underwear with that written on it. It was absurd, but in the best way. It turned something so serious into something ridiculous, which somehow made the message even more powerful.

Speaker 3: That’s the thing about protest — it’s not always about being serious. Sometimes, you need to use humor, absurdity, even shock to get your point across. Like that red flag with the black circle — it was a symbol of resistance, but also a little bit of rebellion. It stood out in the crowd, and it made people look.

Speaker 1: And the sheer scale of it — look at the streets. You could see people from all walks of life. Families, students, workers, old folks, young kids. Everyone was there, united by this one cause: stop the war. I remember thinking, “This is what democracy looks like.” Not just voting every few years, but people actually showing up, making their voices heard.

Speaker 2: It’s funny — I’ve been thinking a lot lately about how protests have changed. Back then, it was all about physical presence. You had to be there, you had to march, you had to hold a sign. Now, it’s all online. You can “like” a protest, share a post, and that’s your activism. But there’s something irreplaceable about being in a crowd, shoulder to shoulder with strangers, all of you united in a common purpose. You feel the energy, the solidarity.

Speaker 3: I agree. There’s a physicality to protest that you can’t replicate online. When you’re standing there, you’re not just expressing an opinion — you’re making a statement with your body. You’re saying, “I am here. I care. I will not be silent.” And that’s powerful. I remember the sound of the crowd — the chants, the clapping, the occasional horn from a passing car. It was like a living, breathing organism.

Speaker 1: And the weather — it was cold, grey, and damp. But no one cared. People were bundled up, hats on, scarves pulled tight, but they were still there. That’s what struck me — the commitment. People weren’t just showing up for a few minutes; they were there for hours, sometimes all day. They were willing to sacrifice their comfort for a cause they believed in.

Speaker 2: That’s what I think is so important — the willingness to show up, even when it’s inconvenient. In a world where we’re so insulated by our screens and our routines, that kind of commitment is rare. It’s a reminder that change doesn’t happen in a vacuum. It happens when people decide to step out of their comfort zones and say, “This is wrong. We need to do something.”

Speaker 3: And it’s not just about stopping a war. It’s about the principle — that we have a right, and a responsibility, to question authority, to challenge decisions that affect our lives, our world. That’s what the “Stop the War Coalition” signs were about. They weren’t just saying “Don’t attack Iraq” — they were saying, “We, the people, have a say in this.”

Speaker 1: Exactly. And even though the war happened anyway, the protest mattered. It showed that there was massive opposition. It gave voice to the voiceless. It reminded the world that not everyone agreed with the decision. And that, in itself, is a victory.

Speaker 2: It’s also a reminder that movements don’t always win in the short term. But they shape the conversation. They plant seeds. And sometimes, those seeds grow into something much bigger — a shift in public opinion, a change in policy, a different kind of world.

Speaker 3: That’s what I love about these images. They’re not just snapshots of a moment. They’re evidence of resistance. They’re proof that people care. And they’re a call to action — to keep showing up, to keep speaking out, to keep fighting for what’s right, even when it’s hard.

Speaker 1: I think that’s the most important thing — that we don’t forget. That we look back at these moments and say, “This is who we are. This is what we stand for.” And then we go out and do it again, when the next fight comes.

Speaker 2: And maybe, just maybe, one day, we’ll look back and see that we were part of something that actually changed the world.
