Speaker 1:  
Man, I still remember that day like it was yesterday. The whole city just… stopped. You could feel it in the air, like everyone was holding their breath. I was walking down Whitehall, and there were people everywhere—on the sidewalks, in the street, even up on the bridges. It was wild.

Speaker 2:  
Yeah, I was near the bridge too. You could see the crowd spilling over the railings, people leaning out just to get a better view. I swear, I saw someone holding a “Socialist Worker” banner up there. It was like a sea of signs and flags. You couldn’t even hear yourself think over the chanting.

Speaker 3:  
I was closer to the front, near that big building with the scaffolding. There was this one sign that really stuck with me—“Bomb from 50,000 feet—inspire terror? People feel more ism!” I mean, it was messy, but you could tell they were trying to make a point. And then there was that red flag with the black silhouette. I didn’t catch who it was, but it was intense.

Speaker 1:  
Oh, I saw that too. That flag was everywhere. It felt like every group had their own symbol. I remember seeing one that said “War is pants.” I laughed out loud. Like, who even comes up with that? But it worked. It was simple, it was funny, and it made you think.

Speaker 2:  
Right? And then there was that big green sign—“Don’t Attack Iraq.” That was from the Stop the War Coalition, right? I think I saw their website on it too. www.stopwar.org.uk. I actually went home and looked it up after. I wanted to see what else they were doing.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, that one was everywhere. I think I saw at least three different versions of it. One had this weird ripple design around the text. It looked like it was vibrating or something. And then there was that other one—“Quelle Connerie La Guerre.” I had to look that up. It means “What nonsense, war.” Pretty sharp, huh?

Speaker 1:  
Totally. I loved how people were just… creative with it. Like, you had the serious stuff, the emotional stuff, and then the absurd stuff. It was all there. I think that’s what made it so powerful. It wasn’t just one message—it was a million messages, all screaming the same thing.

Speaker 2:  
And the crowd… man, it was massive. I’ve never seen anything like it. People were just walking down the street, shoulder to shoulder. No one was in a hurry. Everyone was just… there. Like, we’re all in this together. I remember seeing this guy in a bright green jacket just strolling down the middle of the road like it was a Sunday afternoon.

Speaker 3:  
I saw him too! He was walking with a couple of friends, all laughing. It was weirdly peaceful, you know? Like, we were all there for this huge, angry thing, but there was this weird calm to it. No one was yelling at each other. No one was pushing. It was like we all knew we were part of something bigger.

Speaker 1:  
Yeah, and the police were just… there. Not in your face, not trying to break anything up. Just standing around, watching. I think they knew they couldn’t stop it. It was too big, too loud, too… real.

Speaker 2:  
I think that’s what scared them the most. Not the signs, not the chants. The fact that we were all just… there. Together. Like, what are you gonna do? Arrest a million people? It was a statement in itself.

Speaker 3:  
And the buildings… I mean, you had all these old, fancy buildings lining the street, and then you had this huge crowd of people just taking over. It was like the city was saying, “This is ours now.” I remember looking up at that dome in the distance—the one at the end of the street—and thinking, “Yeah, we’re coming for you too.”

Speaker 1:  
I know what you mean. It felt like we were reclaiming the space. Like, this isn’t just a street for cars or tourists. This is our street. Our city. Our voice. And we’re not gonna be quiet about it.

Speaker 2:  
And the signs… I swear, I saw at least a hundred different ones. Some were funny, some were angry, some were just… poetic. Like that one with the green ripples. It was like a visual metaphor for the ripple effect of war. You know, how one bomb can change everything.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, and then there was that one that said “Stop the War Coalition” with the little peace symbol. It was so simple, but it said everything. No need for fancy words. Just… stop. Please.

Speaker 1:  
I think that’s what stuck with me the most. The simplicity of it. We weren’t asking for anything complicated. We just wanted them to stop. Stop the bombs, stop the lies, stop the fear. Just… stop.

Speaker 2:  
And you know what? I think they heard us. Not right away, maybe. But we made them listen. We made them see that we weren’t going to just sit back and let this happen. We were going to stand up, speak out, and make them pay attention.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah. And we’re still here. Still standing. Still shouting. Still saying, “No war.” Because it’s not over. Not until they finally listen.

Speaker 1:  
Exactly. We’re not done. Not even close.
