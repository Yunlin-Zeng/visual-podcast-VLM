Speaker 1:  
Okay, so I’m still trying to wrap my head around how you even thought to turn a masquerade mask into a wearable tech project. Like, who wakes up one day and goes, “You know what this feathered black mask needs? LEDs and a microcontroller.”

Speaker 2:  
Hey, don’t knock it till you’ve tried it. I was at this costume party last year, and everyone had these boring static masks. I thought, “What if it reacted to movement? Or blinked when you tilted your head?” That’s when the lightbulb went off—literally.

Speaker 3:  
Wait, so you’re saying you built this whole thing from scratch? Like, soldered the circuits yourself? I can barely change a battery without burning my fingers.

Speaker 2:  
Yeah, it wasn’t exactly plug-and-play. First, I had to figure out how to mount the sensor. I used this little accelerometer module—it’s tiny, like the size of a fingernail. I had to sew it into the fabric so it wouldn’t poke through or look weird. Took me three tries before I got the positioning right.

Speaker 1:  
Three tries? That’s dedication. I’d have given up after the first one and just stuck glow sticks on it.

Speaker 2:  
Glow sticks are cheating. Besides, I wanted it to be responsive. The accelerometer feeds data to a tiny microcontroller—Aniomagic, if you’re curious—and that’s what triggers the LEDs. I coded it to pulse when you move your head or blink the lights when you tilt to the side.

Speaker 3:  
That’s actually kind of genius. So you’re basically a wizard with a sewing needle and a soldering iron. Did you have to program it on your laptop? I saw that screen in the background—it looked intense.

Speaker 2:  
Oh yeah, I spent hours on that. The Aniomagic software is surprisingly intuitive once you get past the jargon. I mapped out the sensor triggers and set up the light sequences. I even added a “party mode” where the LEDs flash in sync with music. It’s not perfect, but it’s fun.

Speaker 1:  
Party mode? That’s the kind of feature I can get behind. Did you test it on yourself first, or did you rope someone else into being your guinea pig?

Speaker 2:  
I tested it on myself, obviously. But then my little cousin came over and begged to try it on. She’s seven, and she wore it around the house for like an hour, pretending she was a superhero. She kept saying, “Look, I’m the Light Queen!” It was adorable.

Speaker 3:  
Aww, that’s sweet. Did she notice the tech side of it, or was she just into the feathers and the flashing lights?

Speaker 2:  
She didn’t care about the tech. To her, it was just a magic mask. But she did ask why it “danced” when she moved. I told her it was listening to her, and she believed me. Kids are the best audience for this stuff.

Speaker 1:  
I’m imagining her running around the house, little LED lights blinking with every step. That’s the kind of joy you can’t buy. So, how long did the whole project take? From idea to finished product?

Speaker 2:  
About two weeks, if you count the time I spent staring at the mask wondering how to make it work. The actual building took maybe five or six days, but I had to order parts, wait for shipping, and then troubleshoot when things didn’t work. Like, the first time I tried to glue the battery in place, I used the wrong adhesive, and it came off during testing. Not ideal.

Speaker 3:  
Glue mishaps are the worst. I once glued my fingers together trying to fix a toy. Took me an hour to get them apart. Did you use hot glue for the battery?

Speaker 2:  
Yeah, I switched to hot glue after the first disaster. It’s not the most elegant solution, but it holds. I also added a little Velcro strip to secure the battery pack so it doesn’t shift around. Practicality over aesthetics, right?

Speaker 1:  
Totally. I’d rather have a functional mask than a pretty one that falls apart. Did you add any other features? Like, could it play sounds or something?

Speaker 2:  
I thought about adding a speaker, but that would’ve made it too bulky. Plus, I didn’t want to overcomplicate it. The goal was to keep it lightweight and comfortable to wear. I did consider adding a Bluetooth module so you could control it with your phone, but that’s for version 2.0.

Speaker 3:  
Version 2.0? You’re already planning an upgrade? What’s next? Voice activation? Facial recognition?

Speaker 2:  
Ha, maybe. I’m thinking about adding a light sensor so the mask dims when it’s dark and brightens in low light. Or maybe a gesture control—like, if you wave your hand, it changes the light pattern. The possibilities are endless.

Speaker 1:  
Endless, and slightly terrifying. I can see it now: “Hey Siri, make my mask look like a disco ball.” You’re basically creating the next big wearable trend.

Speaker 2:  
I’ll take that as a compliment. Honestly, I just wanted to make something fun and interactive. It’s not about being the next Apple; it’s about bringing a little magic into everyday life. Even if that magic is powered by a tiny battery and some wires.

Speaker 3:  
I love that. It’s like you turned a costume into a conversation starter. People are going to be asking you how it works at every party.

Speaker 2:  
Exactly. And when they do, I’ll just say, “It’s magic.” Because sometimes, the best tech is the kind that feels like it came from another world.
