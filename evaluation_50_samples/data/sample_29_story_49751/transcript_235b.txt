Speaker 1:  
You know, I still can’t believe we actually made it up here. I mean, we talked about it for years—“someday we’ll go to Banff,” “someday we’ll see the Rockies.” And now? Here we are. And it’s even more insane in person than I imagined.

Speaker 2:  
Right? I swear, every time I turn around, there’s another view that makes me stop and just… stare. Like, I took a photo of these bright orange berries this morning—sea buckthorn, I think?—and behind them, you could see the mountain peaks just glowing in the sun. I didn’t even have to edit it. Nature just handed me a postcard.

Speaker 3:  
I saw that photo. It’s legit. I was standing on that balcony near the Fairmont, trying to get a decent selfie without looking like I’m squinting into the sun. My scarf kept flying everywhere. I swear, the wind up here has a personality. It’s like, “Hey, you want to look cute? Too bad. I’m gonna mess up your hair.”

Speaker 1:  
Haha, I remember that. You looked great though, wind and all. And honestly, that view from the balcony? Unreal. You can see the whole valley—the river, the trees, the snow-capped peaks. I just stood there for like ten minutes, not even moving. Felt like I was in a movie.

Speaker 2:  
Same. I think I took, like, 37 photos of the same mountain range from slightly different angles. I couldn’t help it. It’s like your brain just doesn’t believe it’s real. And then you walk down to the riverbank and it’s even more magical. The water’s so clear and blue, and the mountains are just… there. Like, looming. In a good way.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, I went for a little walk along the river yesterday. There was this bridge in the distance, and the way the light hit the water—it was like liquid glass. And the trees? So green, but also starting to turn. Autumn’s sneaking in, but it’s still so vibrant. I swear, I could’ve just sat there all day with a thermos of coffee and a book.

Speaker 1:  
I’m telling you, this place is the ultimate reset button. Like, I came here stressed about work, deadlines, the whole thing. And now? I feel… lighter. Like, I don’t even remember what I was worried about. The mountains just absorb all that nonsense.

Speaker 2:  
Totally. I think it’s the scale of it all. You feel so small, but in a good way. Like, your problems? They’re tiny compared to these ancient peaks. It’s humbling. And kind of freeing.

Speaker 3:  
Also, the air. Oh my god, the air. It’s so crisp and clean. I kept taking these big, deep breaths like I was trying to store it up for when I get back to the city. I’m gonna miss that. And the quiet. Not total silence, but… peaceful. You hear the wind, the water, maybe a bird. No traffic, no sirens, no notifications.

Speaker 1:  
Exactly. I even turned my phone off for a couple hours yesterday. Just walked around, no map, no agenda. Found this little trail that led to a clearing with the best view of the Fairmont. That hotel looks like it belongs in a fairy tale. All those turrets and windows, nestled in the trees. And the Canadian flag waving on top? So proud.

Speaker 2:  
I love that. It’s like, this grand old lady of a hotel, just sitting there, watching over everything. I read that it was built to attract tourists back in the day. And now? It’s still doing its job. I mean, look at us. We came for the views, but we’re staying for the vibe.

Speaker 3:  
True. And the food? Don’t even get me started. I had this bison burger at the hotel restaurant last night. It was insane. And the local beer? Even better. I’m already planning my next visit. Maybe in winter? I’ve heard the snow here is like something out of a dream.

Speaker 1:  
Winter would be epic. Imagine skiing down those slopes, then coming back to the hotel for hot chocolate by the fire. But honestly? I could come back in any season. Spring with the wildflowers, summer with the hiking trails, fall with the colors… it’s all just… perfect.

Speaker 2:  
I think that’s the thing. It’s not just one moment or one view. It’s the whole experience. The way the light changes, the way the air smells, the way you feel when you’re here. It’s like the mountains are reminding you to slow down, to breathe, to just… be.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah. And I’m so glad we did this. I mean, life gets so busy, and we keep saying, “We’ll do it later.” But later never comes unless you make it happen. And we did. We made it happen.

Speaker 1:  
Cheers to that. And to more adventures. Because if this is what we get when we actually follow through? I’m all in.

Speaker 2:  
Same. Let’s make a pact. Next year, we go somewhere equally wild. Maybe Alaska? Or Patagonia? Somewhere with mountains, water, and zero Wi-Fi.

Speaker 3:  
Deal. But first, let’s go back to that riverbank. I want to sit there again, just us, the water, and those mountains. No phones, no plans. Just… here.

Speaker 1:  
Perfect. Let’s go. And maybe grab some of those sea buckthorn berries on the way. I heard they’re good for you. Or at least, they look good in photos.

Speaker 2:  
Haha, deal. Let’s go get lost in the beauty. Again.
