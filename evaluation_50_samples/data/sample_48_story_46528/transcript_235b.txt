Speaker 1:  
Okay, so I’m just gonna say it—graduation day was a total blur. Like, I remember walking up to the stage, but everything before and after? Gone. Poof. Like my brain just hit save and quit.

Speaker 2:  
Same. I swear I was in autopilot. I remember my mom yelling “Smile!” from the crowd like ten times. And I’m just up there, clutching that diploma like it’s a life raft.

Speaker 1:  
Oh my god, yes. And the tassel. Why does everyone make such a big deal about the tassel? I felt like I was performing some sacred ritual. “Turn it to the left, child, you’re officially an adult now.” Meanwhile, I’m still trying to figure out how to do laundry without shrinking everything.

Speaker 2:  
Right? And the cap. That thing was a menace. I kept adjusting it every five seconds. I’m pretty sure I looked like I was trying to shoo away a fly the whole time.

Speaker 1:  
Haha, I know. I think I had to fix mine at least three times during the ceremony. And don’t even get me started on the gown. It was so big I felt like I was wearing a tent. I kept thinking, “If I sneeze, I’m gonna knock someone over.”

Speaker 2:  
Totally. I was sitting next to this guy who kept fidgeting with his gown like he was trying to hide something. Turns out he was just trying to keep his phone from falling out of his pocket. Graduation fashion: functional, not flattering.

Speaker 1:  
Speaking of fashion, I still can’t believe my mom wore that black dress. She looked so elegant, and I was just this purple blob next to her. I kept thinking, “Why didn’t I get a better gown? Why is mine so… shiny?”

Speaker 2:  
Your gown was fine! It was the same as everyone else’s. And honestly, you looked amazing. I mean, you were glowing. Even with the cap falling off halfway through the ceremony.

Speaker 1:  
Oh, don’t remind me. That was mortifying. I was halfway down the aisle, and suddenly—*whoosh*—my cap just slid off. I had to bend down, pick it up, and keep walking like nothing happened. I’m pretty sure half the crowd thought I was bowing.

Speaker 2:  
You handled it like a pro. And hey, at least you didn’t trip. I saw this girl in front of me trip over her gown and almost faceplant into the stage. She recovered like a champ, though. That’s the spirit of graduation—grace under pressure.

Speaker 1:  
True. And the speeches? I swear, I zoned out halfway through. Something about “the future is yours” and “chase your dreams.” I was just thinking, “Can I eat yet? I’m starving.”

Speaker 2:  
Same. I think I counted how many times the principal said “proud” in his speech. It was like, seven? Eight? I lost track. But hey, at least the food after was good. I remember that cake. It was so good I almost cried.

Speaker 1:  
That cake was a masterpiece. I think I ate three slices. And the punch? Don’t even get me started. I’m pretty sure it was 90% sugar and 10% regret.

Speaker 2:  
Haha, true. But it was worth it. I mean, we made it. Four years, countless all-nighters, and a whole lot of caffeine. And now we’re officially done. No more homework, no more tests, no more waking up at 6 a.m. for first period.

Speaker 1:  
I’m still not used to it. I keep waking up early, thinking I have to get ready for school. And then I remember—oh right, I don’t. It’s weird. Liberating, but weird.

Speaker 2:  
Same. I think I’m gonna miss it, though. Not the stress, obviously, but the routine. The friends. The whole vibe of being in school. It’s like we’re stepping into this big, unknown future, and I’m equal parts excited and terrified.

Speaker 1:  
Yeah. I keep thinking about what’s next. College? A job? Travel? I have no idea. But I guess that’s the point, right? To figure it out as we go.

Speaker 2:  
Exactly. And hey, we’ve got each other. We’ll figure it out together. Even if it means wearing oversized gowns and tripping over our own feet along the way.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. And if I ever need to borrow your cap, I’ll let you know. Mine’s still a little crooked.

Speaker 2:  
Haha, you’re welcome to it. Just don’t lose it this time. And hey, next time we’re at a ceremony, let’s make a pact: no tassel-turning drama. We’ll just smile, wave, and get out of there before anyone notices we’re still wearing our caps indoors.

Speaker 1:  
Agreed. And next time, we’re bringing snacks. Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that you can’t survive graduation on hope and punch alone.

Speaker 2:  
Preach. Now, let’s go eat some more cake. I think I saw a slice left over.

Speaker 1:  
Lead the way. And don’t forget the punch. We’ve got to celebrate properly.

Speaker 2:  
Always. Here’s to us, the graduates. May our futures be as bright as our purple gowns.

Speaker 1:  
Cheers to that.
