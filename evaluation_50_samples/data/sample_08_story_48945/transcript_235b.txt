Speaker 1:  
Dude, I still can’t believe we actually pulled off that whole backyard barbecue thing. Like, who even has a brick fireplace AND a grill built into it? That’s next-level patio goals.

Speaker 2:  
Right? I was low-key stressed about the salmon. I mean, I know I’m not a chef, but I didn’t want to serve everyone raw fish. Especially not after that one time with the chicken wings.

Speaker 3:  
Oh my god, don’t remind me. I still have nightmares about those wings. But seriously, the salmon was legit. Crispy skin, perfect inside. You nailed it.

Speaker 1:  
Thanks, man. I think the secret was the olive oil and lemon juice combo. And not flipping it too early. Patience, people. Patience.

Speaker 2:  
Also, props to you for not burning the house down. That fireplace was practically breathing fire. I was half-expecting the neighbors to call the cops.

Speaker 3:  
Nah, they were probably just jealous. I saw Mrs. Henderson peeking over her fence with her phone out. She was probably live-streaming it for her book club.

Speaker 1:  
Haha, I bet. “Book Club Tuesday: Grilling with the Hot Neighbor.” She’d totally make that a thing.

Speaker 2:  
Anyway, what about the snacks? That dip you made—what even was that? It was weirdly good.

Speaker 3:  
It was my grandma’s “secret” potato salad. Except I swapped out the mayo for Greek yogurt and added a little mustard. And a dash of paprika. It’s not fancy, but it’s addictive.

Speaker 1:  
Addictive is right. I think I ate half the bowl before anyone else even got a plate. And those cookies? The ones with the sprinkles? I’m pretty sure I stole three.

Speaker 2:  
You didn’t steal them. You “borrowed” them. With intent to return… eventually. Also, I saw you trying to hide the evidence in your hoodie pocket.

Speaker 3:  
Classic. And don’t even get me started on the chips. Who brings two different kinds? That’s overkill. But also… genius.

Speaker 1:  
Hey, variety is the spice of life. Plus, you never know who’s gonna show up with weird dietary restrictions. Or just really strong opinions about potato chips.

Speaker 2:  
Speaking of weird opinions, remember when we tried to convince Sarah that sour cream and onion was the superior flavor? She nearly walked out.

Speaker 3:  
She did walk out. To get more chips. And then came back with a whole new bag. She’s a traitor.

Speaker 1:  
Fair. But hey, at least she didn’t bring her dog. That thing is a menace. Remember last time? It stole my sandwich right off my plate.

Speaker 2:  
Oh, I remember. You were so mad. You chased it around the yard yelling, “That was my last bite!”

Speaker 3:  
And then you tripped over the grill grate and almost set your pants on fire. Classic.

Speaker 1:  
Okay, okay, I’ll admit it—I’m not the most graceful person. But at least I didn’t fall asleep on the beach like some people.

Speaker 2:  
Hey, I was tired! And it was dark. And the sand was warm. And I had a beer. It was basically a nap in paradise.

Speaker 3:  
Paradise? You were snoring on a towel next to a bag of chips. And your dog was staring at you like you were a weird statue.

Speaker 1:  
That dog is a menace, I’m telling you. It’s like it has a sixth sense for when someone’s about to fall asleep. Then it just… watches. Creepy.

Speaker 2:  
It’s not creepy. It’s loyal. And also, you’re the one who kept feeding it your leftovers. So maybe don’t be surprised when it follows you around like a furry shadow.

Speaker 3:  
True. But still. That stare? Unsettling. Like, “I know your secrets, human.”

Speaker 1:  
Alright, I’ll give you that. The dog is weirdly intense. But also kind of cute. In a terrifying, slightly unhinged way.

Speaker 2:  
Exactly. Like a tiny, furry ninja. Silent, deadly, and obsessed with snacks.

Speaker 3:  
And don’t forget—super photogenic. I swear, every picture we took with it looked like a professional ad for “Adopt a Weird Dog.”

Speaker 1:  
That’s because it is. We should start a campaign. “Adopt a Dog Who Will Judge You While You Eat.”

Speaker 2:  
I’d sign up for that. Especially if it came with free chips.

Speaker 3:  
Same. But only if the chips are sour cream and onion. No compromises.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. And next time, we’re doing it at my place. I’ve got a new grill. And a dog-proof fence.

Speaker 2:  
You better. And I’m bringing the dip. And the cookies. And maybe a second bag of chips. Just in case.

Speaker 3:  
And I’ll bring the beer. And the sunscreen. Because if we’re doing this again, we’re doing it right. No more falling asleep on the beach. Unless it’s after dessert.

Speaker 1:  
Agreed. And no more stealing cookies. Unless it’s a group effort.

Speaker 2:  
Group effort it is. But only if we all promise not to let the dog near the food. Again.

Speaker 3:  
Too late. It’s already planning its next heist. I can see it in its eyes.

Speaker 1:  
Then we’ll just have to be faster. And sneakier. And maybe a little more prepared.

Speaker 2:  
Or we could just let it win. Sometimes, the dog deserves the chips.

Speaker 3:  
True. But only if it shares. And doesn’t stare. At least not while we’re eating.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. Now, who’s up for another round? I’ve got more salmon. And a new grill technique.

Speaker 2:  
I’m in. But only if you promise not to set anything on fire.

Speaker 3:  
Same. And if you do, I’m blaming the dog.
