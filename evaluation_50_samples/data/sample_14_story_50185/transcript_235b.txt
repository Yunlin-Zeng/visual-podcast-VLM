Speaker 1:  
Man, I still can’t believe we pulled that off. Like, a church wedding followed by a barn reception? That’s not exactly your run-of-the-mill combo.

Speaker 2:  
Right? I mean, we talked about it for months—“Should we go traditional? Should we go rustic? What if we do both?” And then we just… did both. And honestly? It worked.

Speaker 3:  
It totally did. I remember walking into that church and just—wow. The light coming through that stained glass behind the altar? Pure magic. And the way the ceiling was painted with all those angels? Felt like we were in a movie.

Speaker 1:  
Yeah, and the organ music when we walked in? Chills. Real chills. I think even my dad got emotional. And he never cries.

Speaker 2:  
He did! I saw him wipe his eye when you came down the aisle. And then you—oh my gosh, you looked incredible. That dress? The veil? The way you smiled? I swear, I forgot how to breathe for a second.

Speaker 3:  
Same. And then there was the groom—standing there, looking like a prince in that tux, but with that giant beard and those glasses? So you. So uniquely you.

Speaker 1:  
Hey, I’m proud of the beard. It’s my signature. And I’m glad you liked the tux. Took me forever to find one that didn’t make me look like I was going to a funeral.

Speaker 2:  
It was perfect. And then after the ceremony—bam! We’re in a barn. With fairy lights. And hay bales. And that dance floor? I still can’t believe we danced on a barn floor.

Speaker 3:  
I loved it! It was so unexpected. Like, one minute you’re in this sacred, hushed space with candles and incense, and the next you’re in a barn with cowboy hats and a DJ spinning “Cotton Eye Joe.”

Speaker 1:  
Don’t forget the cowboy hat. I had to wear it. It was part of the “rustic” theme. And honestly? I kinda felt like a movie star. Everyone was cheering when I put it on.

Speaker 2:  
You looked ridiculous. And amazing. And I loved every second of it. Especially when you spun me around and nearly knocked over that table with the punch bowl.

Speaker 3:  
Oh, I remember that! The punch bowl nearly went flying. And then everyone just started laughing. It was perfect chaos.

Speaker 1:  
Chaos is my middle name. Well, not really. But it should be. I mean, we had a priest bless the wine, and then ten minutes later we were doing line dances in cowboy boots. That’s the kind of day I want to remember.

Speaker 2:  
Same. And the food! Oh my gosh, the food. Those mini sliders? The mac and cheese bites? I ate so much I thought I was going to burst.

Speaker 3:  
And the cake! That three-tiered masterpiece with the rustic flowers? I still have a photo of you two cutting it with that giant knife. You both looked so happy.

Speaker 1:  
We were. I mean, I didn’t think I could be that happy. Like, I knew I loved you, but seeing you in that dress, standing there with me, in front of everyone we love? It hit me differently.

Speaker 2:  
Me too. I kept thinking, “This is it. This is the moment.” And then we walked out and everyone threw rice—or was it birdseed?—and I just started crying. Happy tears, though.

Speaker 3:  
Happy tears are the best tears. And then the photos! I still look at them sometimes. Like that one where you two are standing in front of the altar, surrounded by all those red candles? So romantic.

Speaker 1:  
That was right after the ceremony. We were just soaking it all in. I remember thinking, “This is real. This is actually happening.”

Speaker 2:  
And then we went to the barn and it was like, “Okay, time to party!” I loved how everyone just let loose. Even Aunt Linda was dancing.

Speaker 3:  
Aunt Linda! She was in the back, doing the robot. I didn’t even know she could do that.

Speaker 1:  
She surprised us all. And then there was that guy who kept trying to get everyone to do the “Electric Slide.” I think he thought he was the DJ.

Speaker 2:  
He was enthusiastic, I’ll give him that. And I loved how the barn was decorated—those garlands with the little lights, the wooden beams, the way it all felt so cozy and warm.

Speaker 3:  
It was like a fairy tale, but with more cowboys and less princesses. Which, honestly, suits you two perfectly.

Speaker 1:  
Thanks. I think we pulled off the “elegant but weird” vibe pretty well. And I’m glad we did it our way. No rules, no expectations—just us, our people, and a whole lot of love.

Speaker 2:  
Exactly. And I wouldn’t change a thing. Not the church, not the barn, not the cowboy hat, not even the near-disaster with the punch bowl.

Speaker 3:  
Same. It was messy, it was magical, it was totally you. And I’m so glad I got to be there to see it all unfold.

Speaker 1:  
We’re lucky to have you. And everyone else who came. It meant the world to us.

Speaker 2:  
It meant the world to us too. And I can’t wait to do it all over again—maybe next time with kids in tow.

Speaker 3:  
Oh, I can already picture it. Tiny cowboy hats. Miniature wedding dresses. And you two, still dancing like no one’s watching.

Speaker 1:  
That’s the dream. And hey, if we can pull off a church-barn wedding, we can handle anything.

Speaker 2:  
Agreed. Bring on the next adventure.
