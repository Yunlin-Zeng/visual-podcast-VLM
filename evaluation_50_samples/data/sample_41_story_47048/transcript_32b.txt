Speaker 1: So I was looking through these photos from the game last weekend, and I gotta say, the energy in that gym was unreal. I mean, just the sheer number of people showing up—especially for a home game—was something else. I remember walking in and seeing the bleachers packed with red and white, and it was like, “Wow, this is what it feels like to be part of something.”

Speaker 2: Totally. I was there, and I swear, the atmosphere was electric. I mean, even before the first tip-off, the band was already warming up, and you could hear the horns and the drums from the other side of the gym. It was like the whole place was vibrating. I remember thinking, “Man, I wish I had brought my camera.”

Speaker 3: Yeah, I know what you mean. I actually brought my camera, and I’m glad I did. I got some really great shots. Like that one of the guy dunking over the mascot? That was insane. I mean, the timing was perfect. I was just sitting there, and all of a sudden, he’s in mid-air, and the mascot is right there, kind of like, “What the—?” It was hilarious. I almost dropped my camera laughing.

Speaker 1: Oh, I saw that photo! That’s one of my favorites. I mean, the mascot was just standing there, like, “I’m supposed to be the star here!” But seriously, the dunk was ridiculous. I don’t think I’ve ever seen someone go that high. I’m pretty sure he was airborne for like three seconds.

Speaker 2: It was wild. And you know what’s even better? The crowd went absolutely nuts. I was sitting right behind the basket, and when he dunked, I swear I felt the floor shake. People were on their feet, screaming, and then the band started playing that one song—what’s it called? “We Are the Champions”? No, wait, it’s that other one, the one with the heavy drums. Anyway, it was like the whole gym just exploded.

Speaker 3: Oh, you’re talking about “Eye of the Tiger.” That’s the one. And you’re right—it was like a full-on movie scene. I was trying to film it on my phone, but the crowd was so loud, I couldn’t even hear the music over the cheering. It was insane. I think that’s the moment I realized, “Okay, this isn’t just a game. This is a whole event.”

Speaker 1: Totally. And it wasn’t just the players. I mean, look at the fans. The way everyone was dressed—red and white, hats, shirts, sweatshirts—it was like a sea of school pride. I saw this one couple sitting in the front row, and they were just beaming. He had on a jacket with the school colors, and she was in a hoodie with “State” on it. They were just smiling, like, “This is our moment.”

Speaker 2: Oh, I saw them too! I think they were actually students. They were sitting right next to that family with the little kid in the blue jersey. The mom was holding him, and he was wearing this little baseball cap, and he kept tipping it like he was in a parade. It was so cute. I think he was probably three or four. He was just soaking it all in.

Speaker 3: That kid was adorable. I think he was part of the Jaycees Little League, judging by his shirt. And the mom? She was wearing a red hoodie with “State” on it too. She was smiling so big, like she was proud of him just being there. I think that’s what made the whole night special—not just the game, but the people. The fans, the kids, the band, the mascot—it all came together.

Speaker 1: Exactly. And speaking of the band, I have to say, they were on fire. I mean, they were in the bleachers, but they were practically on stage. The tubas, the trumpets, the saxophones—it was like a full orchestra. I think they even had a kid playing the saxophone, and he was, like, 12 years old, and he was killing it. I was so impressed.

Speaker 2: I know, right? And they were all wearing red shirts with “Beat the Bird” on them. That’s our school’s slogan, right? “Beat the Bird”? I think it’s because our mascot is a bird. Or a cardinal. Something like that. Anyway, they were all chanting it during the game, and it was so loud, you could hear it from the court.

Speaker 3: Yeah, “Beat the Bird” was everywhere. I saw it on shirts, on hats, even on the girls’ scarves. There were three girls sitting together, and they were all wearing red, and one of them had a scarf that said “Beat the Bird” on it. They were laughing and smiling, and I think they were probably friends from the same dorm or something. They looked like they were having the time of their lives.

Speaker 1: I think that’s what it’s all about—community. Whether you’re a student, a parent, a fan, or even just someone who came to watch, you’re part of this thing. And it’s not just about winning or losing. It’s about being there, supporting each other, and just having fun.

Speaker 2: I couldn’t agree more. I mean, I’ve been to a lot of games, but this one felt different. Maybe it was the energy, or maybe it was just the fact that everyone was so into it. But I walked out of that gym feeling really good. Like, “Yeah, we’re a team. We’re a family.”

Speaker 3: And that’s the thing. It’s not just about the sport. It’s about the experience. The music, the fans, the players, the mascot—everything. I think that’s what makes school spirit so powerful. It’s not something you can fake. It’s something you feel.

Speaker 1: Absolutely. And honestly, I’m already looking forward to the next game. I think I’m going to bring my camera again. There’s just something about capturing those moments—like that dunk, or the little kid tipping his hat, or the band playing their hearts out—that makes you remember why you love this place.

Speaker 2: Same here. I’m going to start a photo album just for these games. I want to look back on these moments and remember how loud the crowd was, how proud everyone looked, and how much fun we had.

Speaker 3: And maybe one day, we’ll show these photos to our kids, and they’ll say, “Wow, that’s what it was like when you were in school.” And we’ll smile and say, “Yeah, it was pretty awesome.”

Speaker 1: It really was.
