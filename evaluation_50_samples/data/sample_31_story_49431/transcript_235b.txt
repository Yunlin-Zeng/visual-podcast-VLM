Speaker 1:  
You know, I used to think that if you just explained things clearly enough, people would get it. But now? I’m not so sure. Sometimes, the more you explain, the more they tune out.

Speaker 2:  
Oh, absolutely. It’s like you’re speaking in a language they don’t want to learn. I’ve had this happen at conferences—standing up, thinking I’ve got the perfect analogy, and then seeing half the room check their phones. It’s humbling.

Speaker 3:  
Humbling? More like demoralizing. I had a guy once—guy with a beard, looked like he’d just stepped out of a Tolkien convention—ask me after a talk, “So… what’s the point again?” I’d just spent 45 minutes breaking down the socio-political implications of algorithmic bias. He wanted the elevator pitch. In one sentence.

Speaker 1:  
That’s the thing, though. People don’t want the whole cake. They want the frosting. And if you give them the whole cake, they get overwhelmed. Maybe we’re just bad at packaging.

Speaker 2:  
Or maybe we’re bad at listening. I mean, think about it—how often do we actually pause and ask, “What do you already know?” or “What’s your biggest question?” Instead, we just launch into our spiel like we’re the only ones who’ve ever thought of this.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, and then we get frustrated when no one follows. I used to be like that. Now I try to start with, “What’s confusing you?” or “What part do you want me to slow down on?” It changes everything. People light up when you ask them that.

Speaker 1:  
I like that. It’s less about delivering and more about co-creating. Like, “Here’s what I know, but I want to know what you need.” It’s way less intimidating for them, and honestly? It’s way less pressure for me.

Speaker 2:  
Totally. And it’s not just about the content—it’s about the vibe. If you’re tense, they’re tense. If you’re relaxed, they’re more open. I’ve noticed that when I’m not trying to impress, people actually lean in.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, I used to wear suits to every talk. Thought I had to look the part. Now I show up in a button-down and a blazer, and I’m way more comfortable. People respond to that. They’re not looking for a performance—they’re looking for a person.

Speaker 1:  
Same. I used to think I had to be the expert on everything. Now I’m okay saying, “I don’t know, but here’s how I’d find out.” That actually builds trust. People respect honesty more than perfection.

Speaker 2:  
And it’s okay to be wrong. I had a guy challenge me once on a data point. I thought I was right, but I double-checked—and I was wrong. I admitted it on the spot. You know what happened? He thanked me. Said he’d never seen a speaker do that before.

Speaker 3:  
That’s huge. We’re so conditioned to be infallible. But the truth is, nobody expects you to be perfect. They expect you to be real. And real is messy. Real is uncertain. Real is willing to change your mind.

Speaker 1:  
Exactly. I’ve started framing things as “Here’s what I think now, but I’m open to being convinced otherwise.” It invites conversation instead of shutting it down.

Speaker 2:  
And it’s not just about the audience—it’s about you too. If you’re rigid, you’re not learning. If you’re open, you’re growing. I’ve had some of my best ideas come from someone asking a dumb question.

Speaker 3:  
“Dumb” questions are the best. They’re usually the ones that cut through the jargon. Like, “Why does this matter?” or “Who does this actually help?” Those are the questions that force you to get to the heart of it.

Speaker 1:  
Right. And sometimes, the answer is, “I’m not sure.” And that’s okay. It’s better than pretending you have all the answers.

Speaker 2:  
I’ve learned to embrace the “I don’t know.” It’s not a weakness—it’s an invitation. An invitation for someone else to jump in, to share, to collaborate. That’s where the real magic happens.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, and it’s way more fun. I used to stress out before every talk, trying to anticipate every possible question. Now I just show up, take a breath, and say, “Let’s figure this out together.” It’s less about me and more about us.

Speaker 1:  
That’s the shift, isn’t it? From “I’m here to teach you” to “I’m here to learn with you.” It’s a different energy. Lighter. More human.

Speaker 2:  
And honestly? It’s more effective. People remember the conversation, not the lecture. They remember how you made them feel, not how many facts you threw at them.

Speaker 3:  
So next time you’re up there, just relax. Be yourself. Ask questions. Admit when you’re wrong. And if someone asks you to explain it again? Smile. Say, “Great question. Let me try that another way.”

Speaker 1:  
Yeah. Because at the end of the day, it’s not about being right. It’s about being connected. And that’s something no amount of jargon can fake.

Speaker 2:  
Preach. And if you ever forget that? Just remember the guy with the beard who asked for the one-sentence summary. He’s out there. And he’s waiting for you to make it simple.

Speaker 3:  
And real. Don’t forget real.
