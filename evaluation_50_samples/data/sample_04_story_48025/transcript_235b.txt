Speaker 1:  
Man, I still can’t believe we actually made it to Malmö for the World Juniors. Like, who even thinks they’re gonna be here? I mean, I’ve been watching this tournament since I was a kid, and now I’m standing in the arena, eating overpriced popcorn, and wearing a sweater that says “Canada Forever” like I’m some kind of national hero.

Speaker 2:  
Right? And the energy in here? Unreal. I swear, I’ve never seen so many people in one place scream so loud and still manage to smile the whole time. Even the guy next to me who’s been yelling at the refs since the first period—he’s got this weirdly sweet vibe. Like, he’s angry but also… proud? I don’t know. It’s confusing.

Speaker 3:  
Oh, you mean Bob? Yeah, Bob’s a legend. He’s been coming to every game since ’98. I think he’s got a spreadsheet tracking how many times he’s yelled “Ref, you blind!” across the years. But honestly? He’s the reason I keep coming back. You know, the passion. It’s contagious.

Speaker 1:  
Wait, Bob’s the guy in the hat with the maple leaf that looks like it’s about to fly off? Yeah, I saw him. He was pointing at the ice like he was directing traffic. And then his wife—what’s her name? Linda?—she just starts waving that little Canadian flag like she’s conducting an orchestra. It was adorable.

Speaker 2:  
Linda’s the best. She’s got this little camera strapped to her arm—looks like a tiny robot hand—and she’s just… documenting everything. I saw her take a photo of the mascot, then a selfie with Bob, then a video of the crowd cheering. I think she’s building some kind of time capsule for her grandkids.

Speaker 3:  
She’s got a whole system. She even has a checklist: “Capture mascot interaction,” “Get crowd shot,” “Film post-game fireworks.” I swear, she’s got more structure than the coaching staff. And the fireworks? Oh my god, those fireworks. I don’t even care if we lose, as long as we get to see those.

Speaker 1:  
Okay, but the fireworks last night? I thought I was gonna cry. Like, I’m not even exaggerating. They lit up the sky behind those bare trees, and it was just… magic. I mean, I’ve seen fireworks before, but not like this. It was like the sky was celebrating us, you know? Like, “Hey, you guys made it. You deserve this.”

Speaker 2:  
I was trying to take a picture, but my phone just couldn’t handle it. Everything came out blurry, but honestly? That made it better. It looked like a painting. Like, you could see the streaks of light through the branches, and it felt… dreamy. I don’t even know how to explain it.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, that’s the thing about these moments. They’re not meant to be captured perfectly. They’re meant to be felt. Like, you’re standing there, freezing your butt off, and you’re just… present. No phones, no distractions. Just you, the crowd, the cold air, and the sky exploding with color.

Speaker 1:  
And the mascot! Oh my god, the mascot. I swear, that thing is the MVP of this whole tournament. It’s got horns, it’s got a jersey, it’s got this weirdly intense smile like it’s about to win the Stanley Cup. I saw it high-fiving kids, dancing with fans, even doing this little victory lap after Canada scored. It’s like the spirit of the whole team wrapped up in a fuzzy costume.

Speaker 2:  
I think I saw it trying to photobomb Linda’s camera. She was trying to get a serious shot of Bob, and the mascot just waltzed in, stuck its tongue out, and waved. Linda didn’t even get mad. She just laughed and took the picture anyway. That’s the vibe here, right? Nothing’s too serious. Even the mascot knows how to have fun.

Speaker 3:  
And that’s why I love this tournament. It’s not just about hockey. It’s about the people. The fans, the families, the weird little traditions. Like, I saw this kid today wearing a sweater that said “My Dad’s a Ref, But I Still Love Him.” I mean, come on. That’s gold.

Speaker 1:  
Right? And the food! Don’t even get me started on the food. I had this giant pretzel that was basically the size of my head, and it was amazing. I think I ate it in three bites. I’m pretty sure I’m gonna regret it tomorrow, but tonight? Tonight, I’m living my best life.

Speaker 2:  
Same. I’m still full from the poutine I had at halftime. And the beer? Don’t even get me started. I think I’ve had three, and I’m not even tipsy. I’m just… happy. Like, genuinely happy. I don’t even care if we win or lose. I’m just glad I’m here.

Speaker 3:  
That’s the spirit. That’s what this is all about. It’s not just a game. It’s a celebration. Of hockey, of Canada, of community. And honestly? I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. Even if Bob yells at the refs one more time, and even if Linda takes 500 more photos, and even if the mascot tries to steal my pretzel—I’m good. I’m really, really good.

Speaker 1:  
Agreed. Let’s just hope the fireworks are just as good tonight. And if they’re not? Well, we’ll just make our own magic. Right?

Speaker 2:  
Right. Let’s go, Canada. And let’s go, us. We’ve earned this.
