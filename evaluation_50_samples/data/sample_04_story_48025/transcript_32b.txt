Speaker 1: So I was thinking, what if we took a little detour from the usual podcast format today? Instead of talking about the latest news or trends, maybe we could just... talk. Like, really talk. You know, the kind of conversation you’d have with a friend over coffee or while walking the dog.

Speaker 2: I like that. I’ve been feeling a bit... stuck in the same loop lately. Like, I’m constantly trying to be productive, to check off boxes, and I haven’t just *been* in a while. So yeah, let’s do it. What’s on your mind?

Speaker 1: Honestly? I’ve been thinking a lot about how we measure success. Like, I mean, we’re always told to chase goals, to climb the ladder, to get the next thing. But I saw this picture the other day—of this mascot, this big bull thing in a yellow jersey, holding a flag. And it made me think: why do we put so much weight on symbols? Like, the flag, the jersey, the trophy. What if the real win is just... showing up?

Speaker 2: That’s a great point. I mean, I’ve been to games where the crowd is going wild, and you see people in full gear, waving flags, screaming their lungs out. And you know what? Some of them are probably just there for the experience, not because they’re rooting for the team to win. They’re there to feel something, to be part of something bigger than themselves. I think that’s powerful.

Speaker 3: I was at a game like that last weekend. It was freezing cold, and I was sitting in the stands with my parents. My dad’s wearing this old Canadian hat, and my mom’s in this white lace shirt, and they’re both cheering like crazy. She’s got her arms up, waving a red scarf, and she’s laughing. I remember thinking, “This is it. This is what joy looks like.” Not the scoreboard, not the final result—just that moment of pure, unfiltered happiness.

Speaker 1: That’s beautiful. And it’s so human. We get so caught up in outcomes—did we win? Did we make the sale? Did we get the promotion?—but sometimes the real victory is just being present. Like, being there with your parents, feeling the cold, sharing that moment. That’s something you can’t measure.

Speaker 2: Exactly. And I think that’s why I love fireworks. Not because they’re flashy or loud, but because they’re fleeting. Like, they explode in the sky, and then they’re gone. But for that one moment, they’re so bright, so alive. You can’t help but stop and look. It’s like a reminder to pay attention—to the beauty, to the moment, to the people around you.

Speaker 3: I’ve been thinking about that too. I took a photo of fireworks once, and it came out blurry. Not because I didn’t focus, but because I was trying to capture the feeling, not the image. The blur made it feel more real, somehow. Like, the firework wasn’t just a shape in the sky—it was a burst of emotion, of awe, of wonder. And the trees in the background, dark and still, made the light even more intense.

Speaker 1: That’s such a poetic way to put it. I think we’re all trying to capture that same thing—meaning, connection, beauty. But sometimes we forget to look up. We’re so busy scrolling or typing or planning that we miss the fireworks. Even if they’re not literal.

Speaker 2: Or even if they’re small. Like, I had a moment the other day when I was walking home, and I saw this single streetlight reflecting off a wet sidewalk. It looked like a tiny star. And for a second, I stopped. I didn’t take a photo. I just stood there and breathed. And that felt like a win.

Speaker 3: That’s the thing, isn’t it? The wins don’t have to be big. They can be tiny, quiet moments. Like watching your mom cheer at a hockey game, or seeing a firework through the branches of a tree, or just noticing a streetlight on a rainy night. Those are the things that stay with you.

Speaker 1: And they’re the things that make life feel full. Not the trophies or the titles or the social media likes. But the moments that make you feel alive, that make you say, “Wow, I’m here. I’m *here*.”

Speaker 2: I think that’s what we’re all chasing, deep down. Not success as the world defines it, but presence. Being fully in the moment, with the people we love, experiencing the world as it is—beautiful, messy, fleeting.

Speaker 3: And maybe that’s why the mascot matters too. Not because he’s winning, but because he’s there. He’s dressed up, he’s waving the flag, he’s part of the celebration. He’s not perfect, he’s not human, but he’s *there*. And that’s kind of the point.

Speaker 1: So maybe the real championship isn’t about who scores the most goals or who gets the most likes. Maybe it’s about who shows up, who laughs, who cheers, who looks up at the fireworks and says, “This is magic.”

Speaker 2: And who doesn’t forget to look up.

Speaker 3: Amen to that. Let’s keep showing up. Even if it’s just to watch the fireworks through the trees.
