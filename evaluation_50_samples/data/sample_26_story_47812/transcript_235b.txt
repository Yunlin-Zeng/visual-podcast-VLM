Speaker 1:  
You know, I was just looking through some old photos last night, and I swear, every time I see that one of Grandma with the pink gift bag, I just laugh. She’s got that grin like she just pulled off the best prank ever.

Speaker 2:  
Oh, that’s the one where she’s wearing that gray sweatshirt with the “MI” flag, right? She loved that thing. Wore it to church, to the grocery store, even to the doctor’s office. I think she thought it made her look “patriotic and stylish.”

Speaker 1:  
It did! And honestly, she pulled it off. I mean, who else could rock a Michigan flag sweatshirt and make it look like high fashion? She had that sparkle in her eye, even when she was just sitting at the kitchen table.

Speaker 2:  
Totally. And then there’s the photo with Aunt Carol leaning over her shoulder, looking like she’s about to whisper some secret. That was the day we surprised her with the flowers, remember? We thought she’d cry, but she just laughed and said, “You kids are ridiculous.”

Speaker 1:  
She did! And then she spent the next hour trying to figure out how to arrange those pink blooms in a vase that didn’t match anything else in the house. She was so particular about her decor.

Speaker 2:  
That’s Grandma. Everything had to be just so. Even her coffee mug had to be the “good” one, not the chipped one from the back of the cabinet.

Speaker 1:  
Speaking of coffee, remember when Uncle Dave showed up unannounced with that giant bag of beans from his trip to Colombia? Grandma made him brew it, and then she spent twenty minutes critiquing the grind size.

Speaker 2:  
Oh my gosh, yes! She said, “David, this is too fine. You’re going to end up with sludge, not coffee.” And he just stood there, nodding like he was getting a masterclass.

Speaker 1:  
He was. She was basically a coffee sommelier. But hey, at least he brought the good stuff. I still have that bag of beans somewhere. Maybe I should try brewing it again.

Speaker 2:  
Do it. And then send me a picture of your face when you taste it. I bet it’s still as strong as the day he brought it home.

Speaker 1:  
Deal. But let’s talk about the kitchen photo with Mom, Dad, and that cousin we never see anymore. What’s her name again? The one with the patterned jacket?

Speaker 2:  
Oh, you mean Lisa? Yeah, she was always the quiet one. But look at her in that photo—she’s smiling so big, you’d never guess she was the one who hid behind the couch at every family gathering.

Speaker 1:  
Right? And Dad’s wearing that Chewbacca shirt. I swear, he bought that thing just to annoy Mom. She hated Star Wars, but he’d wear it every time she had guests over.

Speaker 2:  
Classic Dad. And Mom’s just standing there, pretending she doesn’t notice. But you can see the little smirk. She loved him, even when he was being ridiculous.

Speaker 1:  
They were a pair. Remember when they tried to cook Thanksgiving together? Dad was in charge of the turkey, and Mom was doing the stuffing. It ended with Dad accidentally setting off the smoke alarm and Mom yelling, “I told you not to use the flamethrower!”

Speaker 2:  
He didn’t actually have a flamethrower, did he?

Speaker 1:  
No, but he did try to “crisp up” the skin with a kitchen torch. It was a disaster. But they laughed the whole time. That’s what I miss most—how they could turn any mess into a memory.

Speaker 2:  
Same. And then there’s that photo of you and your partner, all cozy in front of the mirror. You guys look so happy. I remember that day—you were just back from that trip to the coast, right?

Speaker 1:  
Yeah, we’d just gotten home and were still in our travel clothes. We were supposed to be unpacking, but instead we just sat on the couch and ate takeout while watching that terrible reality show we both pretend to hate.

Speaker 2:  
You mean “Celebrity Chef Wars”? I still can’t believe you two binge-watched all six seasons.

Speaker 1:  
Hey, don’t judge. It’s comfort TV. And besides, it’s not like we were doing anything productive. We were just happy to be home, together.

Speaker 2:  
That’s the best kind of happy. Simple, quiet, no big plans—just being.

Speaker 1:  
Exactly. And then there’s that last photo, with Grandpa and that cousin who always had a joke ready. What’s her name again? The one with the glasses and the big smile?

Speaker 2:  
Oh, you mean Maria? She’s the one who taught Grandpa how to use that tablet. He was so proud of himself when he finally figured out how to send a text.

Speaker 1:  
He was! And Maria just sat there, grinning like she’d won the lottery. She always had this way of making him feel like a kid again. Like he could still learn new things, even at his age.

Speaker 2:  
That’s what family’s for, right? To remind us that we’re never too old to grow—or to laugh.

Speaker 1:  
True. And I think that’s why we keep these photos around. Not just to remember the big moments, but the little ones too. The ones where we’re just sitting, smiling, being together.

Speaker 2:  
Yeah. Because those are the moments that stick. The ones where we’re not trying to be perfect—just present.

Speaker 1:  
Exactly. And honestly? I wouldn’t trade any of them for the world. Even the ones where Dad’s wearing that Chewbacca shirt.

Speaker 2:  
Same. Even the coffee sludge. Especially the coffee sludge.

Speaker 1:  
Cheers to that.
