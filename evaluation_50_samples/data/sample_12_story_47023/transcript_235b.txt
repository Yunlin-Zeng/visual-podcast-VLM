Speaker 1:  
Man, I didn’t think croquet would be this competitive. I mean, I came for the snacks and the shade, not to get schooled by a guy in a patterned shirt.

Speaker 2:  
Hey, don’t blame me. You’re the one who said, “I used to play this in my backyard as a kid.” And then you missed the wicket by, like, a foot.

Speaker 3:  
Wait, wait—did you just say “wicket”? Are we playing croquet or cricket? Because I’m confused and also mildly terrified.

Speaker 1:  
It’s croquet, genius. Wicket is the hoop thing you hit the ball through. And I’m not a genius, I’m just… strategically challenged.

Speaker 2:  
Strategically challenged? That’s a nice way of saying you’re terrible at this. But hey, at least you’re having fun. Right?

Speaker 3:  
Fun? I’m currently being stared down by a toddler holding a mallet like it’s a lightsaber. He’s got this look in his eye like he’s about to take over the world. Or at least this lawn.

Speaker 1:  
That’s Liam. He’s three. And he’s already better at this than half the adults here. His mom’s just chilling with a water bottle like, “Yep, that’s my kid, destroying your ego.”

Speaker 2:  
Honestly, I think the real MVP is the woman in the teal shirt. She’s been running this whole thing like a military operation. She’s got the scorecard, the mallets organized, and somehow convinced everyone to wear name tags.

Speaker 3:  
Name tags? At a croquet tournament? What is this, a corporate team-building exercise disguised as a garden party?

Speaker 1:  
Pretty much. But hey, free food, free drinks, and free lawn games? I’m not complaining. Plus, I think I just saw someone bring out a tray of mini quiches.

Speaker 2:  
Mini quiches? Okay, now I’m officially invested. Forget the game—I’m here for the snacks.

Speaker 3:  
Same. But also, can we talk about how the tent is basically a giant oven? I’m sweating through my shirt, and I didn’t even know I could sweat that much.

Speaker 1:  
Welcome to Florida summer. You think you’re prepared, and then the humidity hits you like a truck. I swear, I saw a bird drop out of the sky earlier. It was just like, “Nope. Too hot.”

Speaker 2:  
That’s not funny. That’s tragic. But also, kind of relatable. I feel like I’m melting into this chair.

Speaker 3:  
At least you’re sitting. I’m standing here holding this mallet like I’m supposed to know what I’m doing. I’m pretty sure I just hit the ball into someone’s picnic basket.

Speaker 1:  
Don’t worry, I think that’s part of the game. Or at least, it should be. “Bonus points if you knock over the cheese platter.”

Speaker 2:  
Speaking of cheese platters, did you see the one by the yellow table? It’s got brie, cheddar, and something that looks suspiciously like blue cheese. I’m not touching that unless someone else tries it first.

Speaker 3:  
Blue cheese is an acquired taste. Like, “I used to hate it, but now I’m weirdly obsessed” kind of taste. You’ll get there.

Speaker 1:  
I’ll get there when I’m 80 and my taste buds have given up. Until then, I’m sticking with the safe stuff. Like those mini quiches. Are they still there?

Speaker 2:  
Yeah, but you’re gonna have to fight the guy in the patterned shirt for them. He’s got his eye on them too.

Speaker 3:  
Oh, so now we’re fighting over quiches? This is getting out of hand. Next thing you know, we’ll be playing croquet for the last slice of cake.

Speaker 1:  
Don’t give them ideas. I’m already imagining a croquet tournament where the prize is a giant slice of chocolate cake. I’d win that. I’d sacrifice my dignity for cake.

Speaker 2:  
Same. I’d even wear a name tag if it meant I got cake. Which, by the way, I’m still not sure why we’re wearing these. Is this a networking event or a lawn game?

Speaker 3:  
I think it’s both. You know, “Let’s bond over croquet and then maybe we’ll hire you.” Or maybe it’s just to make sure we don’t accidentally hit each other with mallets.

Speaker 1:  
That’s a valid point. I mean, I almost took out the toddler earlier. He’s fast. And he doesn’t care about personal space.

Speaker 2:  
He’s also got the best outfit. Plaid shorts, little suspenders, and that serious face. He’s basically a tiny businessman who’s here to win.

Speaker 3:  
I’m starting to think he’s the real boss here. Maybe we should all just bow down and let him take the trophy.

Speaker 1:  
Trophy? There’s a trophy? Why didn’t anyone tell me? I’m suddenly very motivated.

Speaker 2:  
It’s not a real trophy. It’s a plastic cup with a ribbon on it. But hey, it’s the thought that counts.

Speaker 3:  
A plastic cup? That’s the prize? I’m out. I’m going to find the quiches and pretend I never heard about this.

Speaker 1:  
Wait, don’t leave! We need you to be our team’s moral support. Or at least, our snack runner.

Speaker 2:  
Yeah, and if you see the woman in the teal shirt, ask her if there’s a second round of quiches. I’m already planning my strategy.

Speaker 3:  
Strategy? You mean the one where you pretend to know what you’re doing and hope for the best?

Speaker 1:  
Exactly. That’s the winning strategy. Now, who’s up for another round? I think I’ve got this.

Speaker 2:  
You say that every time. And every time, you miss the wicket.

Speaker 3:  
Wicket? Again with the wicket? I’m still not sure what that is.

Speaker 1:  
It’s the hoop. The thing you hit the ball through. Just… never mind. Let’s just eat the quiches and call it a day.

Speaker 2:  
Agreed. Croquet can wait. Snacks can’t.
