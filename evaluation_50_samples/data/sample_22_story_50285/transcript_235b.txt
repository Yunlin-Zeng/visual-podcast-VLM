Speaker 1:  
You know, I still can’t believe we pulled it off. Like, we didn’t have a big budget, didn’t have a planner, just showed up with flowers in our hair and a whole lot of hope.

Speaker 2:  
Hope and a little bit of chaos. Remember when we realized the photographer was running late and we were just standing there like, “Uh… should we start without him?” And then Dad showed up with his old digital camera like he was saving the day.

Speaker 1:  
Oh my gosh, yes! Dad’s “professional” camera that he swore took “better pictures than those fancy DSLRs.” And honestly? He got some of the best shots. That one where we’re holding hands and looking up at the sky? Pure magic. He caught the light just right.

Speaker 2:  
And the way you looked in that dress—seriously, I didn’t even know you were going to wear that top. I thought you were going to go full ballgown. But that silk top with the mandarin collar? So you. So elegant. And the flower crown? Genius. You looked like a garden fairy who got married in a living room.

Speaker 1:  
Hey, I told you I wanted something simple but meaningful. No big venue, no 200 guests, just us, Dad, and the people who really mattered. And honestly? I wouldn’t change a thing. Even the fact that we had to rearrange the couch to make space for the “aisle.”

Speaker 2:  
That couch! We were basically standing in front of Grandma’s old floral monstrosity. I kept thinking, “Is this what people mean by ‘cozy’? Because this is aggressively cozy.” But then you turned around, and I forgot all about the couch. All I saw was you.

Speaker 1:  
Stop it, you’re gonna make me cry again. I swear, I cried more during our vows than I did during the entire planning process. And that kiss? I still get butterflies thinking about it.

Speaker 2:  
That kiss was… I mean, I didn’t even know I could feel that much in one moment. Like, the whole world just paused. And then we pulled back and you had this little smirk like, “Gotcha.” And I was like, “Yeah, you definitely got me.”

Speaker 1:  
You’re such a sap. But I love that about you. Even now, when we’re just sitting on the couch watching bad TV, I still look over and think, “I married my best friend.” And it still feels surreal.

Speaker 2:  
Same. I still look at my ring sometimes and think, “How did I get so lucky?” I mean, look at this thing. It’s not some huge diamond or anything, but it’s perfect. Simple, solid, just like us.

Speaker 1:  
Exactly. We didn’t need flashy. We needed real. And I think that’s what made it so special. No pressure, no expectations, just two people who really, really wanted to be together.

Speaker 2:  
And we did it our way. No fancy caterers, no DJ, just Dad playing his old CD of “Our Song” on repeat. And the cake? That little thing from the grocery store with the edible flowers? I swear, it was the best cake I’ve ever had.

Speaker 1:  
Because it was ours. Even the little mishaps—the fact that I almost tripped over my dress walking to the “altar,” or that you forgot to put on your left shoe until the last minute—those are the moments I remember the most. They’re the ones that make it real.

Speaker 2:  
And now, looking back, I wouldn’t trade any of it. Not the chaos, not the last-minute decisions, not even the fact that we had to take our own photos because the photographer was stuck in traffic. It was perfect because it was us.

Speaker 1:  
Totally. And you know what? I think that’s the secret to a good marriage. Not having everything go perfectly, but having someone who’s willing to laugh with you when it doesn’t. Who’s there to hold your hand when you’re nervous, or kiss you when you’re scared, or just sit with you in silence when you need it.

Speaker 2:  
Yeah. And I’m so glad I get to do that with you. Every day. Even when we’re arguing over whose turn it is to take out the trash, or when you’re stealing the blankets again. I wouldn’t want to do any of it with anyone else.

Speaker 1:  
Same. And hey, if we ever need a reminder of how far we’ve come, we can just look at those photos. The ones where we’re standing in front of the couch, or kissing under the porch light, or holding hands like we’re never letting go.

Speaker 2:  
And we won’t. Not ever. Because this? This is forever. And I’m so glad we started it with flowers in our hair and a whole lot of love.

Speaker 1:  
Me too. Now, let’s go make some more memories. Maybe this time, we can actually remember to put on both shoes before the ceremony.

Speaker 2:  
Deal. But only if you promise to wear that dress again. Or at least the flower crown. I’m a sucker for the flower crown.

Speaker 1:  
You’re ridiculous. But fine. For you? I’ll wear the crown. And maybe even the couch.
