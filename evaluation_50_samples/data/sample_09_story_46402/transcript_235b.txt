Speaker 1:  
You know, I still get chills thinking about graduation day. It felt like the whole world was watching, even though it was just our little high school on a football field.

Speaker 2:  
Right? And the way they set it up—rows and rows of us in those blue gowns, sitting on folding chairs like we were at a big outdoor concert. I remember being so nervous I almost dropped my diploma when I walked up.

Speaker 3:  
I was more worried about my cap falling off. I swear, those things were designed to slip at the worst possible moment. I had to glue mine on with double-sided tape the night before.

Speaker 1:  
Haha, same! My mom was like, “Just wear it loose, it’ll look more natural.” Natural? I looked like a confused penguin trying to balance a hat on my head.

Speaker 2:  
But seriously, the speaker that year—wasn’t that Mr. Henderson? He was always the quiet one in the hallway, but he got up there and gave this speech that made half the crowd tear up.

Speaker 3:  
Yeah, he talked about how we were all “seeds planted in different soil, but growing toward the same sun.” I wrote that down. I still have it in my journal.

Speaker 1:  
That’s beautiful. I remember thinking, “Wow, I’m actually graduating.” Like, it wasn’t just a thing that happened to other people—it was happening to me.

Speaker 2:  
And then after the ceremony, everyone just散开了—families hugging, people taking photos on the track, kids throwing caps in the air. I ran straight to my grandma. She was sitting on the bleachers with her camera ready.

Speaker 3:  
I did the same thing. My mom had this green rain jacket on—she always wore it to every event, rain or shine. I hugged her so tight, I think I almost crushed her.

Speaker 1:  
I remember my grandpa too. He wore that light blue windbreaker with the pink shirt underneath. He looked so proud, even though he kept saying, “I can’t believe you’re done. Where did the time go?”

Speaker 2:  
That’s what everyone says, right? “Where did the time go?” But honestly, it flew by. One minute you’re in middle school trying to figure out algebra, the next you’re walking across a field in a cap and gown holding a red carnation.

Speaker 3:  
Speaking of flowers—I still have mine. I pressed it in a book. It’s all brittle now, but I keep it as a reminder.

Speaker 1:  
I gave mine to my little sister. She was in middle school then, and she wore it to her own graduation three years later. She said it brought her good luck.

Speaker 2:  
That’s so sweet. I remember my sister was there too, wearing that Michigan State hoodie. She kept saying, “You’re gonna miss me when I’m gone,” even though she was only going into eighth grade.

Speaker 3:  
Haha, siblings. Always trying to make you feel guilty. But honestly, I think she was just proud. She kept taking pictures of me with her phone, even though she wasn’t supposed to.

Speaker 1:  
Same. My brother was sneaking pics too. He kept yelling, “Smile, you’re famous now!” I just rolled my eyes, but secretly, I loved it.

Speaker 2:  
It’s funny how those little moments stick with you. Like, I can still smell the grass from the field, feel the breeze, hear the crowd cheering when they called my name.

Speaker 3:  
And the flowers on the stage—those white and purple ones by the podium. I thought they were so fancy. Now I know they were probably from the school’s garden club.

Speaker 1:  
Still looked beautiful. And the way the sun hit the field right before they started handing out diplomas? Pure magic.

Speaker 2:  
I wish I’d taken more photos. I was so caught up in the moment, I barely looked at my phone. Now I’m scrolling through old albums, trying to relive it.

Speaker 3:  
Same. I found one of me and my mom sitting on the track, smiling like we just won the lottery. I didn’t even remember taking it.

Speaker 1:  
I think that’s the thing about graduation—it’s not just about finishing school. It’s about the people who got you there. The teachers, the parents, the friends who stayed up late helping you study.

Speaker 2:  
And the ones who showed up even when they didn’t have to. Like my aunt, who drove three hours just to see me walk across the stage. She brought me a bouquet and a card that said, “You did it, kid.”

Speaker 3:  
That’s the stuff that matters. Not the cap, not the gown, not even the diploma. It’s the love. The pride. The feeling that you’re not alone.

Speaker 1:  
Yeah. And even though we’ve all gone our separate ways now—college, jobs, moving cities—I still feel connected to that day. Like we’re all carrying a piece of it with us.

Speaker 2:  
Me too. Sometimes I’ll be walking down the street or sitting in a coffee shop, and I’ll think, “I made it. I’m still here. Still growing.”

Speaker 3:  
And we’re not done yet. That’s the best part. Graduation wasn’t the end—it was the beginning.

Speaker 1:  
Exactly. And I can’t wait to see where we all go next.

Speaker 2:  
Same. Let’s promise to check in once a year. No matter where we are.

Speaker 3:  
Deal. And next time, we’ll bring flowers. For old times’ sake.

Speaker 1:  
And maybe some red carnations. Just like we did that day.
